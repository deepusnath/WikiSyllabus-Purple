## Overview

Computer Vision explores advanced techniques for automated analysis and understanding of visual data. The course covers deep learning approaches, 3D vision, object recognition, and scene understanding. Students develop expertise in modern computer vision algorithms and their applications to real-world problems. This Part C course provides comprehensive coverage of current research topics and practical implementation skills in computer vision.

## Learning Objectives

- Master deep learning architectures for computer vision tasks
- Understand 3D geometry and multiple view reconstruction
- Implement advanced object detection and recognition systems
- Analyze video sequences and temporal visual data
- Apply computer vision techniques to robotics and autonomous systems
- Evaluate and compare state-of-the-art vision algorithms

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2: Deep Learning for Vision**
- Convolutional neural networks and architectures
- Object detection and semantic segmentation
- Transfer learning and domain adaptation

**Weeks 3-4: 3D Vision and Geometry**
- Camera calibration and stereo vision
- Structure from motion and SLAM
