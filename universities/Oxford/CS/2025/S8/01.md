## Overview

Advanced Security explores cutting-edge topics in cybersecurity including advanced cryptographic protocols, system security, and emerging threats. The course covers formal security models, protocol analysis, and implementation of secure systems. Students develop expertise in security research methodologies and gain understanding of current challenges in cybersecurity. This Part C course provides the theoretical foundation and practical skills needed for research in information security.

## Learning Objectives

- Master advanced cryptographic protocols and their security analysis
- Understand formal security models and proof techniques
- Analyze and design secure distributed systems and protocols
- Implement and evaluate security mechanisms in practice
- Identify and mitigate emerging security threats
- Conduct rigorous security research and vulnerability analysis

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2: Advanced Cryptographic Protocols**
- Multi-party computation and secret sharing
- Zero-knowledge proofs and their applications
- Homomorphic encryption and privacy-preserving computation

**Weeks 3-4: Formal Security Analysis**
- Security models and definitions
- Provable security and reduction-based proofs
- Protocol verification using formal methods

**Weeks 5-6: System Security**
- Operating system security and isolation mechanisms
- Hardware security and trusted computing
- Side-channel attacks and countermeasures

**Weeks 7-8: Emerging Security Challenges**
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency security
- IoT and embedded system security
- AI security and adversarial machine learning

## Assessment & Workload

Part C courses require approximately 15 hours per week of study. Assessment is by take-home mini-project involving security analysis of a complex system or protocol, including both theoretical analysis and practical implementation components.
