## Overview

The Major Individual Project Part 2 represents the culmination of the student's independent research work, focusing on implementation, evaluation, and documentation of findings. Students complete their research project, conduct comprehensive experiments, and produce a substantial dissertation demonstrating mastery of research methods and deep understanding of their chosen area. This final component showcases the student's ability to contribute original knowledge to computer science.

## Learning Objectives

- Complete implementation of proposed research solution
- Conduct rigorous experimental evaluation and analysis
- Write a comprehensive research dissertation
- Present research findings effectively to academic and technical audiences
- Demonstrate critical thinking and original contribution to the field
- Reflect on research process and identify future directions
