## Overview

Models of Computation explores theoretical foundations of computer science, including automata theory, formal languages, computability, and complexity theory. This course provides the mathematical framework for understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computation.

## Learning Objectives

- Master finite automata and regular languages
- Understand context-free languages and pushdown automata
- Learn Turing machines and computability theory
- Analyze computational complexity classes
- Apply theoretical concepts to practical problems

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Regular Languages
- Finite automata and regular expressions
- Pumping lemma for regular languages
- Closure properties and decision problems

**Weeks 3-4**: Context-Free Languages
- Context-free grammars and pushdown automata
- Pumping lemma for context-free languages
- Parsing and ambiguity

**Weeks 5-6**: Turing Machines and Computability
- Turing machine models and variants
- Undecidability and the halting problem
- Recursive and recursively enumerable languages

**Weeks 7-8**: Complexity Theory
- Time and space complexity classes
- P, NP, and NP-completeness
- Reduction techniques and complexity relationships

## Assessment & Workload

Theoretical problem sets, formal proofs, and examinations focusing on mathematical rigor and conceptual understanding. Tutorial sessions emphasize proof techniques and theoretical analysis.
