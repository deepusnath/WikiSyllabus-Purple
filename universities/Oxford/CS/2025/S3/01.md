## Overview

Compilers covers the design and implementation of programming language translators. Students learn lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization techniques essential for understanding how programming languages are processed and executed.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand compiler architecture and phases
- Implement lexical analyzers and parsers
- Design semantic analysis and type checking
- Generate and optimize intermediate code
- Apply compiler techniques to language implementation

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Lexical Analysis
- Regular expressions and finite automata
- Token recognition and scanner generation
- Error handling in lexical analysis

**Weeks 3-4**: Syntax Analysis
- Context-free grammars and parsing
- Top-down and bottom-up parsing methods
- Parser generators and tools

**Weeks 5-6**: Semantic Analysis
- Symbol tables and scope resolution
- Type checking and type inference
- Attribute grammars and semantic actions

**Weeks 7-8**: Code Generation and Optimization
- Intermediate code generation
- Register allocation and instruction selection
- Basic optimization techniques

## Assessment & Workload

Compiler implementation project, theoretical exercises, and examinations. Practical work includes building components of a working compiler for a simple language.
