## Overview

Concurrent Programming covers the design and implementation of multi-threaded and parallel systems. Students learn synchronization mechanisms, parallel algorithms, and techniques for building correct and efficient concurrent software in modern multi-core environments.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand concurrency models and parallel programming paradigms
- Master synchronization primitives and coordination mechanisms
- Design thread-safe data structures and algorithms
- Analyze correctness and performance of concurrent systems
- Apply parallel programming techniques to practical problems

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Concurrency Fundamentals
- Threads, processes, and shared memory
- Race conditions and critical sections
- Mutual exclusion and locks

**Weeks 3-4**: Synchronization Mechanisms
- Semaphores and monitors
- Message passing and channels
- Atomic operations and lock-free programming

**Weeks 5-6**: Parallel Algorithms
- Parallel algorithm design patterns
- Load balancing and work distribution
- Performance analysis and scalability

**Weeks 7-8**: Advanced Topics
- Transaction memory and software transactional memory
- Distributed programming models
- Deadlock detection and prevention

## Assessment & Workload

Concurrent programming assignments, parallel algorithm implementations, and performance analysis projects. Focus on correctness verification and efficiency optimization.
