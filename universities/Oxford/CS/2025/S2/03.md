## Overview

Functional Programming introduces the functional programming paradigm using languages like Haskell or ML. Students learn functional programming concepts, type systems, and mathematical foundations that provide alternative approaches to software design and problem-solving.

## Learning Objectives

- Master functional programming concepts and syntax
- Understand type systems and type inference
- Apply higher-order functions and recursion
- Learn monads and advanced functional patterns
- Compare functional and imperative programming paradigms

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Introduction to Functional Programming
- Basic syntax and function definitions
- Pattern matching and guards
- Lists and list comprehensions

**Weeks 3-4**: Higher-Order Functions
- Functions as first-class values
- Map, filter, and fold operations
- Function composition and currying

**Weeks 5-6**: Type Systems
- Static typing and type inference
- Algebraic data types and polymorphism
- Type classes and instances

**Weeks 7-8**: Advanced Topics
- Monads and functors
- Lazy evaluation and infinite data structures
- Applications and case studies

## Assessment & Workload

Programming assignments in functional languages, theoretical exercises, and examinations. Tutorial sessions focus on functional programming techniques and problem-solving approaches.
