## Overview

Design and Analysis of Algorithms introduces fundamental algorithmic techniques and complexity analysis. Students learn to design efficient algorithms, analyze their performance, and apply algorithmic thinking to solve computational problems across various domains.

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental algorithm design paradigms
- Analyze time and space complexity of algorithms
- Understand data structures and their applications
- Apply algorithmic techniques to practical problems
- Evaluate trade-offs in algorithm selection

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Algorithm Analysis
- Asymptotic notation and complexity analysis
- Best, worst, and average case analysis
- Recurrence relations and master theorem

**Weeks 3-4**: Divide and Conquer
- Merge sort and quick sort algorithms
- Binary search and applications
- Multiplication algorithms

**Weeks 5-6**: Greedy Algorithms
- Greedy choice property and optimal substructure
- Activity selection and scheduling problems
- Graph algorithms: minimum spanning trees

**Weeks 7-8**: Dynamic Programming
- Optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems
- Classic problems: knapsack, longest common subsequence
- Applications to optimization problems

## Assessment & Workload

Algorithm design problems, complexity analysis exercises, and programming implementations. Tutorial sessions focus on problem-solving strategies and analysis techniques.
