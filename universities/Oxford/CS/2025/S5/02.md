## Overview

Computer Graphics covers the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of 2D and 3D graphics systems. Students learn rendering techniques, geometric transformations, lighting models, and interactive graphics programming essential for visualization, gaming, and virtual reality applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Master 3D graphics transformations and coordinate systems
- Understand rendering algorithms and lighting models
- Implement graphics programming using modern APIs
- Apply computer graphics techniques to practical applications
- Analyze performance and optimization in graphics systems

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Graphics Fundamentals
- 2D and 3D coordinate systems and transformations
- Homogeneous coordinates and matrix operations
- Viewing transformations and projections

**Weeks 3-4**: Rendering Techniques
- Rasterization and scan conversion
- Hidden surface removal algorithms
- Texture mapping and filtering

**Weeks 5-6**: Lighting and Shading
- Illumination models and reflection
- Phong and advanced shading techniques
- Ray tracing and global illumination

**Weeks 7-8**: Advanced Topics
