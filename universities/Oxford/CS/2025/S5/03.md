## Overview

Computer Security covers the principles and practices of securing computer systems and networks. Students learn cryptographic methods, network security protocols, system vulnerabilities, and defense mechanisms essential for protecting digital assets and maintaining privacy.

## Learning Objectives

- Master cryptographic algorithms and security protocols
- Understand system and network security vulnerabilities
- Apply security principles to system design and implementation
- Analyze threats and design appropriate countermeasures
- Evaluate security policies and risk management strategies

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Cryptographic Foundations
- Symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Hash functions and digital signatures
- Public key infrastructure and certificates

**Weeks 3-4**: Network Security
- Network protocols and vulnerabilities
- Firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Secure communications and VPNs

**Weeks 5-6**: System Security
- Operating system security mechanisms
- Access control and authentication
- Software vulnerabilities and exploit prevention

**Weeks 7-8**: Advanced Security Topics
- Web application security
- Mobile and cloud security
- Privacy, anonymity, and ethical considerations

## Assessment & Workload

Security analysis projects, cryptographic implementations, and vulnerability assessment exercises. Focus on both theoretical understanding and practical security evaluation skills.
