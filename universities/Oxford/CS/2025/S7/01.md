## Overview

Bayesian Statistical Probabilistic Programming introduces advanced techniques for expressing and solving probabilistic models using computational methods. The course covers probabilistic programming languages, Bayesian inference algorithms, and their applications to complex statistical problems. Students learn to implement sophisticated probabilistic models and develop expertise in modern computational statistics. This Part C course provides deeper theoretical understanding and practical skills for research in machine learning and statistical computing.

## Learning Objectives

- Master probabilistic programming languages and their computational frameworks
- Implement advanced Bayesian inference algorithms including MCMC and variational methods
- Design and analyze complex hierarchical probabilistic models
- Apply probabilistic programming to real-world statistical problems
- Understand theoretical foundations of approximate inference methods
- Develop research-level skills in computational statistics

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2: Probabilistic Programming Foundations**
- Introduction to probabilistic programming languages (Stan, PyMC, Edward)
- Basic syntax and model specification
- Automatic differentiation and computational graphs

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Bayesian Inference**
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and variations
- Variational inference and mean-field approximations
- Importance sampling and particle methods

**Weeks 5-6: Complex Model Design**
- Hierarchical models and random effects
- Non-parametric Bayesian methods
- Model selection and comparison techniques

**Weeks 7-8: Applications and Research Topics**
- Time series and dynamic models
- Deep probabilistic models and neural networks
- Current research directions and open problems

## Assessment & Workload

Part C courses require approximately 15 hours per week of study. Assessment is by take-home mini-project involving implementation of a complex probabilistic model and analysis of results. Students must demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical programming skills in their submissions.
