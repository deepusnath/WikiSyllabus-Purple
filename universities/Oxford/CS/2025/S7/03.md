## Overview

The Major Individual Project is a substantial independent research project that constitutes 3/8 of the Part C assessment. Students work on cutting-edge problems in computer science under academic supervision, developing research skills and deep expertise in their chosen area. Part 1 focuses on literature review, problem formulation, methodology design, and initial implementation. This project demonstrates the student's ability to conduct independent research at a graduate level.

## Learning Objectives

- Conduct comprehensive literature review in a specialized area of computer science
- Formulate and scope a significant research problem
- Design appropriate methodology and experimental framework
- Develop project management and time planning skills
- Begin implementation of proposed solution
- Communicate research progress effectively through written and oral presentations

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2: Topic Selection and Initial Research**
- Explore potential research areas and topics
- Meet with potential supervisors
- Conduct preliminary literature survey
- Define project scope and objectives

**Weeks 3-4: Literature Review and Background**
- Systematic review of relevant literature
- Identify gaps and research opportunities
- Understand current state-of-the-art methods
- Establish theoretical foundations

**Weeks 5-6: Methodology Design**
- Design research methodology and approach
- Plan experimental framework and evaluation metrics
- Consider ethical implications and limitations
- Develop project timeline and milestones

**Weeks 7-8: Initial Implementation**
- Set up development environment and tools
- Implement baseline methods and initial prototypes
- Begin data collection or system development
- Conduct preliminary testing and validation

## Assessment & Workload

The Major Project requires approximately 15-20 hours per week throughout S7 and S8. Part 1 assessment includes progress reports, literature review submission, and supervisor meetings. Students must demonstrate clear research progress and solid foundation for continued work in Part 2.
