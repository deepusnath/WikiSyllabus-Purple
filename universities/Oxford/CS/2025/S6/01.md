## Overview

Computational Complexity provides advanced study of the fundamental limits of computation. Students explore complexity classes, reduction techniques, and the theoretical foundations that determine what problems can be solved efficiently and which ones are inherently intractable.

## Learning Objectives

- Master advanced complexity classes and their relationships
- Understand reduction techniques and completeness results
- Analyze the theoretical limits of efficient computation
- Apply complexity theory to practical algorithm design
- Explore connections between complexity and other areas of computer science

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Advanced Complexity Classes
- Time and space hierarchy theorems
- Polynomial hierarchy and oracle machines
- Alternation and interactive proof systems

**Weeks 3-4**: Randomized Complexity
- Randomized algorithms and complexity classes
- Derandomization techniques
- Probabilistically checkable proofs

**Weeks 5-6**: Circuit Complexity
- Boolean circuits and uniform complexity
