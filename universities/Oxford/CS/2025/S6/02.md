## Overview

Computer Networks covers the design and implementation of network protocols and distributed systems. Students learn network architectures, protocol stacks, routing algorithms, and performance analysis essential for understanding modern internet infrastructure and distributed computing.

## Learning Objectives

- Master network protocol design and implementation
- Understand routing and network topology optimization
- Analyze network performance and reliability
- Apply network programming and socket programming
- Design distributed systems and network applications

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Network Fundamentals
- OSI and TCP/IP protocol stacks
- Physical and data link layer protocols
- Error detection and correction techniques

**Weeks 3-4**: Network Layer and Routing
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Routing algorithms and protocols
- Network topology and graph algorithms

**Weeks 5-6**: Transport and Application Layers
- TCP and UDP protocol design
- Congestion control and flow control
- Application layer protocols and services

**Weeks 7-8**: Advanced Networking
- Network security and cryptographic protocols
- Quality of service and traffic engineering
- Wireless and mobile networking

## Assessment & Workload

Network programming projects, protocol implementation assignments, and performance analysis studies. Focus on both theoretical understanding and practical network development skills.
