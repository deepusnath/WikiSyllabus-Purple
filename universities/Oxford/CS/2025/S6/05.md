## Overview

Information Theory provides mathematical foundations for quantifying and processing information. Students learn entropy, coding theory, channel capacity, and compression algorithms essential for data communication, cryptography, and machine learning applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental concepts of information entropy and mutual information
- Understand coding theory and optimal compression algorithms
- Apply information-theoretic principles to communication systems
- Analyze channel capacity and error-correcting codes
- Connect information theory to machine learning and statistical inference

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Information and Entropy
- Shannon entropy and conditional entropy
- Mutual information and relative entropy
- Properties and applications of information measures

**Weeks 3-4**: Source Coding
- Kraft inequality and optimal codes
- Huffman coding and arithmetic coding
- Universal source coding and Lempel-Ziv algorithms

**Weeks 5-6**: Channel Coding
- Channel capacity and the noisy channel theorem
- Linear codes and syndrome decoding
- Hamming codes and BCH codes

**Weeks 7-8**: Advanced Topics
- Rate-distortion theory and lossy compression
- Information theory in machine learning
- Network information theory and multiuser channels

## Assessment & Workload

Theoretical problem sets focusing on information-theoretic analysis, coding algorithm implementations, and applications to practical systems. Mathematical rigor required for proofs and derivations.
