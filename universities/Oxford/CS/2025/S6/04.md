## Overview

The Third-Year Project is an individual research project that allows students to investigate a specific area of computer science in depth. Students work under faculty supervision to conduct original research, implement systems, or explore theoretical questions, culminating in a substantial dissertation.

## Learning Objectives

- Conduct independent research in a chosen area of computer science
- Apply research methodologies and experimental design
- Implement and evaluate novel systems or algorithms
- Develop technical writing and presentation skills
- Demonstrate mastery of advanced computer science concepts

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Project Planning and Literature Review
- Research question formulation and scope definition
- Literature review and related work analysis
- Research methodology and experimental design

**Weeks 3-4**: Implementation and Development
- System design and architecture planning
- Implementation of core functionality
- Data collection and experimental setup

**Weeks 5-6**: Evaluation and Analysis
- Experimental evaluation and data analysis
- Performance measurement and optimization
- Validation of research hypotheses

**Weeks 7-8**: Documentation and Presentation
- Dissertation writing and technical documentation
- Research presentation preparation
- Final project demonstration and defense

## Assessment & Workload

Individual research project with substantial implementation component, comprehensive dissertation, and oral presentation. Assessment based on originality, technical quality, and research contribution.
