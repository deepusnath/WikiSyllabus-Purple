## Overview

Advanced Databases extends fundamental database concepts to cover distributed databases, big data systems, and modern database architectures. Students explore advanced query processing, database system internals, and emerging database technologies for large-scale data management.

## Learning Objectives

- Master advanced database system architectures and internals
- Understand distributed database design and management
- Apply big data processing frameworks and technologies
- Design and optimize complex database applications
- Analyze performance and scalability of database systems

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Advanced Query Processing
- Query optimization algorithms and cost models
- Join algorithms and execution strategies
- Parallel query processing and execution

**Weeks 3-4**: Database System Internals
- Storage management and buffer pool algorithms
- Index structures and access methods
- Recovery algorithms and crash recovery

**Weeks 5-6**: Distributed Databases
