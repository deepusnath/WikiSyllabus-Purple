## Overview

Imperative Programming introduces fundamental programming concepts using an imperative language, typically Java or C++. Students learn core programming constructs, object-oriented design principles, and software development practices essential for computer science studies.

## Learning Objectives

- Master basic programming constructs and syntax
- Understand object-oriented programming principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through programming
- Learn debugging and testing techniques
- Apply software engineering best practices

**Weeks 1-2**: Programming Fundamentals
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Basic input/output operations

**Weeks 3-4**: Functions and Procedures
- Function definition and calling
- Parameter passing mechanisms
- Local and global variables

**Weeks 5-6**: Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and data hiding

**Weeks 7-8**: Data Structures and Algorithms
- Arrays and collections
