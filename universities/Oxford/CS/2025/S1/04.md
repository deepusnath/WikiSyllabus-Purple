## Overview

Introduction to Proof Systems covers formal logic, proof theory, and automated reasoning. Students learn to construct formal proofs, understand logical inference rules, and explore the foundations of mathematical reasoning used in computer science verification and theorem proving.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand formal logic and proof systems
- Master natural deduction and sequent calculus
- Learn automated theorem proving techniques
- Apply proof systems to program verification
- Develop skills in formal mathematical reasoning

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Propositional Logic
- Syntax and semantics of propositional logic
- Truth tables and logical equivalence
- Normal forms and satisfiability

**Weeks 3-4**: Natural Deduction
- Inference rules for propositional logic
- Proof construction and verification
- Soundness and completeness

**Weeks 5-6**: Predicate Logic
- First-order logic syntax and semantics
- Quantifiers and unification
- Resolution and skolemization

**Weeks 7-8**: Applications and Extensions
- Program verification and Hoare logic
- Automated theorem proving
- Logic programming and Prolog

## Assessment & Workload

Formal proof exercises, logical reasoning problems, and examinations. Tutorial sessions focus on proof construction techniques and logical analysis.
