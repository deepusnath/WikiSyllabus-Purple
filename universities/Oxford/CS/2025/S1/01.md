## Overview

Discrete Mathematics provides the mathematical foundations essential for computer science, covering logic, sets, functions, relations, and basic combinatorics. This course establishes the mathematical reasoning skills necessary for algorithm analysis, formal verification, and theoretical computer science.

## Learning Objectives

- Master propositional and predicate logic
- Understand set theory and mathematical proof techniques
- Apply combinatorial methods to counting problems
- Analyze mathematical relations and functions
- Develop skills in mathematical reasoning and formal proof writing

## Syllabus Outline

**Weeks 1-2**: Logic and Proof Techniques
- Propositional logic and truth tables
- Predicate logic and quantifiers
- Direct proof, proof by contradiction, and proof by induction

**Weeks 3-4**: Set Theory and Relations
- Set operations and properties
- Functions and their properties
- Relations and equivalence classes

**Weeks 5-6**: Combinatorics
