# Transport Phenomena

## Course Objectives

1. To impart knowledge in transport of momentum, heat and mass transport and provide insight into the dependence of temperature and pressure on the transport coefficients.  
2. To derive simple shell balances to formulate basic conservation equations of transport processes for solving selected engineering problems which can be solved analytically.  
3. To give basic axioms of conservation namely conservation of momentum, energy and mass.
