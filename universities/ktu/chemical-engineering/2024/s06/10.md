# PBCHT604 - Process Dynamics and Control

## Course Objectives

- Model chemical engineering processes and analyze/predict their dynamics both for open- (without control) and closed-loop (with control) systems.  
- Develop control strategies, select appropriate manipulated inputs, and tune controllers to meet process objectives.  
- Understand the importance of process control in enhancing safety, profitability, and product quality in chemical industries under global and regulatory constraints.
