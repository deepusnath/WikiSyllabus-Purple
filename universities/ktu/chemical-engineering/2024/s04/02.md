# PCCHT402 - Heat Transfer Operations

## Course Objectives

1. Provide a fundamental understanding of basic principles of heat transfer and the various modes of heat transfer.  
2. Solve heat transfer problems using principles and correlations for different modes of heat transfer.  
3. Design and estimate heat transfer rate for equipment such as heat exchangers and evaporators.
