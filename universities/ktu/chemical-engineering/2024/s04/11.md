## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1
**Fundamentals of Fluidization**  
- Phenomenon of fluidization and types of fluidization.  
- Liquid-like behaviour of fluidized beds, advantages and disadvantages in industrial operations.  
- Fluidization quality and contacting mode selection for applications.  
- Minimum fluidization velocity, pressure drop–velocity relationship for uniformly sized particles.  
- Minimum bubbling velocity, effects of temperature and pressure on bed behaviour.  
- Sintering and agglomeration of particles at high temperatures.  
- Geldart particle classification and mapping of fluidization regimes.  
- *Microproject/Assignment*: Particle size distribution, minimum fluidization velocity, and pressure drop calculation.

### Module 2
**Distributors, Entrainment, and Solids Movement**  
- Distributors: types (ideal, perforated plates, tuyeres & caps, pipe grids, spargers).  
- Gas entry region and jets in beds, pressure drop requirements, power consumption.  
- Entrainment and elutriation concepts – FBH (Freeboard Height) and TDH (Transport Disengaging Height).  
- Solid movement: vertical/horizontal movement, segregation, handling large solids in smaller particle beds, staging of beds.  
- *Microproject/Assignment*: Design of distributors.

### Module 3
**Bubbling and Slugging in Fluidized Beds**  
- Single rising bubbles, rise rate, Davidson model, wake region, solids in bubbles.  
- Bubble coalescence and splitting, formation above distributor.  
- Slug flow behaviour.  
- Bubbling fluidized bed: bed property estimation, gas flow in emulsion and bubble phases, bubble size growth, rise velocity.  
- Kunii–Levenspiel (K–L) model for bubbling beds.
