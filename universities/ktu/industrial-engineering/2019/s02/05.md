# EST102: PROGRAMMING IN C

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: analyze a computational problem and develop an algorithm/flowchart to find its solution  
- **co 2**: develop readable C programs with branching and looping statements, which use arithmetic, logical, relational, or bitwise operators  
- **co 3**: write readable C programs with arrays, structure or union for storing the data to be processed  
- **co 4**: divide a given computational problem into a number of modules and develop a readable multi-function C program using recursion if required  
- **co 5**: write readable C programs which use pointers for array processing and parameter passing  
- **co 6**: develop readable C programs with files for reading input and storing output  

## syllabus

### module 1: basics of computer hardware and software

- computer architecture: processor, memory, input & output devices  
- application vs system software: compilers, interpreters, high-level vs low-level languages  
- introduction to structured programming: flowcharts, algorithms, pseudocode  
- examples: bubble sort, linear search  

### module 2: program basics

- C program structure: character set, tokens, identifiers, variables, data types, constants  
- console I/O operations: `printf()`, `scanf()`  
- operators: arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, conditional, assignment, `sizeof`, precedence  
- control flow: `if`, `switch`, `goto`, `while`, `do-while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`  
- sample programs demonstrating control statements  

### module 3: arrays and strings

- arrays: declaration, initialization, 1D and 2D arrays  
- strings: built-in functions (`strlen()`, `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, `strcmp()`, `puts()`, `gets()`)  
- sample programs: linear search, bubble sort, basic string operations  

### module 4: working with functions

- modular programming: defining and using functions  
- function parameters: actual vs formal, pass by value  
- recursion  
- arrays as function parameters  
- structures and unions  
- storage classes, scope and lifetime of variables  
- sample programs using functions and recursion  

### module 5: pointers and files

- pointers: declaration, dereferencing, `NULL`, pointer arithmetic, arrays and functions with pointers, pass-by-reference  
- file operations: `fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`, `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `feof()`, `rewind()`  
- sequential vs random access  
- sample programs covering pointer manipulation and file I/O
