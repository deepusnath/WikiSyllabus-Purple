# EST100: Engineering Mechanics

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental concepts of mechanics applicable to engineering.
* To develop the ability to analyze and solve problems involving rigid bodies under static and dynamic equilibrium.
* To familiarize students with the use of vector mathematics and graphical methods for mechanics problems.
* To lay the foundation for understanding structural and mechanical system behavior in real-world applications.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Recall principles and theorems related to rigid body mechanics. *(Cognitive level: Remember)*
* **CO 2:** Identify and describe the components of system of forces acting on the rigid body. *(Cognitive level: Understand)*
* **CO 3:** Apply the conditions of equilibrium to various practical problems involving different force systems. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
* **CO 4:** Choose appropriate theorems, principles or formulae to solve problems of mechanics. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
* **CO 5:** Solve problems involving rigid bodies, applying the properties of distributed areas and masses. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
