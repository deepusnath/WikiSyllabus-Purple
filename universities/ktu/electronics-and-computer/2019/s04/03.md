# ERT204: OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING USING JAVA

## course outcomes

- **co1**: write java programs using the object oriented concepts - classes, objects, constructors, data hiding, inheritance and polymorphism  
- **co2**: utilize datatypes, operators, control statements, built in packages & interfaces, input/output streams and files in java to develop programs  
- **co3**: illustrate how robust programs can be written in java using exception handling mechanism  
- **co4**: write application programs in java using multithreading and database connectivity  
- **co5**: write graphical user interface based application programs by utilizing event handling features and swing in java  

## syllabus

### module 1: introduction

- basic object-oriented concepts  
- object modeling using uml â€“ uml diagrams: use case model, class diagram, activity diagram  
- introduction to java: java programming and runtime environment  
- development platforms - jvm, compiler, bytecode, buzzwords  
- program structure, comments  
- primitive data types, literals, casting, variables, arrays, strings, vector class  
- operators: arithmetic, bitwise, relational, boolean logical, assignment, conditional, precedence  
- control statements: selection, iteration, jump statements  

### module 2: core java fundamentals

- oops in java: class fundamentals, declaring objects, methods, constructors, `this`, method overloading  
- object parameters, returning objects, recursion, access control, static/final, inner classes, varargs  
- inheritance: super/sub class, `super`, protected, constructor order, method overriding, abstract classes, `final` with inheritance  

### module 3: more features of java

- packages and interfaces: defining, classpath, access protection, importing  
- exception handling: checked/unchecked exceptions, `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, `finally`, nested `try`  
- i/o: console input/output, print writer, object streams, serialization, file handling  

### module 4: advanced features of java

- java library: string handling - constructors, length, operations, comparison, valueOf()  
- collections framework: collection and list interfaces, collections class, arraylist, iterator  
- multithreading: java thread model, main thread, creating/syncing/suspending/resuming/stopping threads  

### module 5: gui and database support

- event handling: mechanisms, delegation model, event classes, sources, listener interfaces  
- swing: components, containers, packages, layout managers, jframe, jlabel, jbutton, jtextfield  
- jdbc: overview, creating and executing queries (create, delete, insert, select)
