# MAT 202: PROBABILITY, STATISTICS AND NUMERICAL METHODS

## course outcomes

- **CO1**: Understand the concept, properties and important models of discrete random variables and, using them, analyse suitable random phenomena.  
- **CO2**: Understand the concept, properties and important models of continuous random variables and, using them, analyse suitable random phenomena.  
- **CO3**: Perform statistical inferences concerning characteristics of a population based on attributes of samples drawn from the population.  
- **CO4**: Compute roots of equations, evaluate definite integrals and perform interpolation on given numerical data using standard numerical techniques.  
- **CO5**: Apply standard numerical techniques for solving systems of equations, fitting curves on given numerical data and solving ordinary differential equations.
