# BMT302: BIOMECHANICS

## course outcomes

- **CO1**: Apply a broad and coherent knowledge of the underlying principles and concepts of basic biomechanics of human bone, skeletal articulations, spine and upper-lower extremity movements.
- **CO2**: Analyse the biomechanics of human skeletal muscles.
- **CO3**: Apply bio-fluid mechanics knowledge to systematically analyse the blood-vascular system.
- **CO4**: Investigate the biomechanics of human systems using models of physiological systems.
