# Control Systems

## course outcomes

- **CO1**: Characterize a control system in Laplace domain and model it in simpler forms.
- **CO2**: Employ time domain analysis to predict and investigate transient and steady state performance parameters of the system for standard test signals.
- **CO3**: Formulate different types of analysis in frequency domain to explain the nature of stability of the system.
- **CO4**: Develop and analyse state space models.
