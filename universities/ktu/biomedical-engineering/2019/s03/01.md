- Analytic functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations.
- Harmonic functions, finding harmonic conjugates.
- Conformal mappings:
  - \( w = z^2 \), \( w = e^z \), \( w = \frac{1}{z} \), \( w = \sin z \).
  - Linear fractional transformations and fixed points.

### Module IV: Complex Variable – Integration

- Complex integration.
