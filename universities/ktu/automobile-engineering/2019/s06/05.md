# AUT322: Numerical Methods

## Course Objectives

- Understand concepts of solving algebraic and transcendental equations.
- Discuss numerical techniques of interpolation for real-life situations.
- Acquaint students with numerical techniques of differentiation and integration.
- Learn various techniques for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
