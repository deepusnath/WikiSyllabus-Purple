# AUT352: Automotive Pollution and Testing

## Course Objectives

- Understand pollutants and emission standards.
- Discuss basic concepts of pollutant formation.
- Understand technologies for controlling emissions.
- Explain emission testing procedures.
- Understand methods of controlling automotive pollution.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Pollution and Standards

- Pollutants: sources; formation; effects on environment and humans.
- Emission standards and regulations: international (US, EU) and Indian standards.
- Compliance: certification; assembly-line testing; in-use surveillance and recall.

### Module 2 — Mechanisms of Pollutant Formation

- Formation of NOx and CO in SI and CI engines.
- Particulate formation in SI and CI engines; soot oxidation; role of soot inhibitors.
- Hydrocarbon formation: aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, organic acids; HC formation in SI and diesel engines.

### Module 3 — Emission Control Technologies

- Gasoline vehicles: air–fuel ratio control; electronic control.
- Catalytic converters: two-way and three-way; catalytic wear and poisoning.
- Diesel vehicles: engine design; exhaust after-treatment; EGR; SCR.
- Other emissions: crankcase, evaporative; fuel dispensing and distribution emissions; control methods.

### Module 4 — I/M Standards and Measurement Procedures

- Inspection & maintenance (I/M) standards: costs, benefits, improvements; impact of tampering; cost-effectiveness.
- Remote sensing of vehicle emissions: data evaluation.
- Emission measurement/testing procedures: light/heavy-duty vehicles; two-wheelers.
- Emissions: crankcase, evaporative, refuelling, on-road.
- Analysers: NDIR, FID, chemiluminescence analysers, smoke meters.

### Module 5 — Control, Programs, and Intelligent Systems

- Emission control inspections for SI engines: exhaust and evaporative emissions; motorcycle white smoke.
- Institutional settings for I/M: centralized vs decentralized; inspection frequency; roadside inspection.
- Vehicle replacement and retrofit programs: scrappage; relocation; replacement; retrofit.
- Intelligent vehicle–highway systems.
