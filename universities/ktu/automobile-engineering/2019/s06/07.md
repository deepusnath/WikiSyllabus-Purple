# AUT342: Vehicle Performance and Testing

## Course Objectives

- Understand basic engine parameters and laboratory testing procedures.
- Gain knowledge about engine exhaust analysers for petrol and diesel engines.
- Explain collision and wind tunnel testing of vehicles.
- Explain the role of NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) and ride/body test procedures.
- Understand wheels and braking performance test procedures.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Laboratory and Chassis Testing

- Basic engine parameters.
- Measurement of BHP and IHP.
- Engine testing on dynamometers; types: hydraulic, eddy-current, etc.
- Vehicle testing on chassis dynamometers: two-wheel and four-wheel dynamometers.
- Vehicle testing lanes: side-slip testers; brake testers; headlight alignment testing.

### Module 2 — Analysers and Energy Consumption Tests

- Engine analysers for petrol and diesel engines.
- Exhaust gas analysers: Orsat apparatus; infrared analysers; smoke meter.
- Energy consumption tests: engine cooling fan, air conditioning, brake compressors.
- Fuel consumption tests: test route selection; vehicle test speeds.

### Module 3 — Crash and Wind Tunnel Testing

- Collision and crash testing: human testing; dummies; crashworthiness; pole and near-crash testing; vehicle-to-vehicle and side-impact testing.
- Crash test sensors: mounting positions; data acquisition; braking distance test.
- Wind tunnel testing: test requirements; ground-boundary simulation; tunnel selection; Reynolds-number capability; model requirements and details; model mounting; test procedure.

### Module 4 — NVH and Ride/Body Testing

- NVH: automotive noise criteria; standard measurement methods; interior and exterior noise.
- Noise sources: intake/exhaust; combustion; mechanical; auxiliaries; wind; transmission; brake squeal; structure-borne noise.
- Noise control methods.
- Ride vibration and body testing: vibration measurement instruments — accelerometers and signal conditioning.

### Module 5 — Wheels and Braking Performance

- Wheel tests: dynamic cornering fatigue; dynamic radial fatigue — procedures.
- Impact tests: road-hazard impact tests for wheel/tyre assemblies — procedures; failure/performance criteria.
- Bumpers: test types; pendulum test; fixed collision barrier test; performance criteria.
- Brakes: air and hydraulic brake tests; air brake actuators; valve tests; performance requirements.
- Parking brake: drawbar pull test; grade holding test.
