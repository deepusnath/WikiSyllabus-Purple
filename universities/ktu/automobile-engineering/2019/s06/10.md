- Explain geometric modelling, numerical control, and FEM.
- Analyse NC part programming and computer-aided part programming.
- Understand computer-aided process planning and FMS concepts.
- Illustrate robotics basics.

## Modules

### Module 1 — CAD/CAM, CIM, and 2D/3D Graphics

- Evolution of CAD/CAM and CIM; industrial perspective of CAD; comparison with traditional design; applications of computers in design.
- CAD system topologies; design database; graphics standards; data exchange formats; virtual reality.
- 2D graphics: line-drawing algorithms — DDA; circle drawing — Bresenham’s algorithm; 2D transformations — translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, clipping.
- 3D graphics basics.

### Module 2 — Geometric Modelling, NC, and FEM

- Geometric modelling: wireframe, surface, and solid modelling; engineering analysis; design review/evaluation; automated drafting.
- Numerical control: need; classifications — point-to-point, straight-cut, contouring; incremental vs absolute systems; open- vs closed-loop systems; DDA integrator and interpolators; resolution; CNC and DNC.
- Finite element analysis: introduction; applications; basic concepts; discretization; element types; nodes and DOF; mesh generation; constraints and loads; pre- and post-processing; software packages.

### Module 3 — NC and Computer-Aided Part Programming

- NC part programming: fundamentals; manual programming; NC coordinate systems and axes; sequence numbers; preparatory functions.
- Computer-aided part programming: concept and need of CAP; CNC languages; APT language structure — geometry, motion, postprocessor, compilation-control commands; programming exercise (illustrative).

### Module 4 — CAPP and FMS

- Computer-aided process planning (CAPP): concept; traditional vs CAPP; automated process planning; group technology methodology; code structures for variant and generative methods; AI in process planning; process-planning software.
- Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS): introduction; types; concepts; need and advantages; cellular manufacturing and FMS; JIT and GT applied to FMS.

### Module 5 — Robotics

- Robot technology: basic components; end effectors; sensors in robotics; control of actuators in robot mechanisms (basics).
- Control of robot joint: stepper motors; direct-drive actuators; hydraulic and pneumatic systems.
- Robot arm kinematics: direct and inverse kinematics; dynamics (overview).
- Applications: material transfer; machine loading/unloading; pre-cutting operations; assembly; inspection; welding.
