- Apply basic design methods for gears.
- Apply basic design methods for internal combustion engine parts.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Design Fundamentals and Failure Theories

- Introduction to design: definition; steps in the design process; preferred numbers; standards and codes.
- Materials and properties: elastic/plastic behaviour; ductile/brittle behaviour; shear, bending, torsional, and combined stresses; stress concentration factor.
- Theories of failure: Guest, Rankine, St. Venant, Haigh, von Mises, Hencky.
- Shock and impact loads; fatigue loading; endurance limit; factors affecting endurance limit; factor of safety.

### Module 2 — Shafts, Couplings, and Bearings

- Shafts: materials; design considerations; causes of failure; design based on strength, rigidity, and critical speed; static and fatigue loading; repeated loading; reversed bending.
- Couplings: selection; classification; rigid vs flexible; design of keys and pins.
- Rolling-contact bearings: types; selection; bearing life; static/dynamic load capacity; axial/radial loads; dynamic equivalent load.
- Sliding-contact bearings: lubrication and lubricants; viscosity; journal bearings; hydrodynamic theory; Sommerfeld number; design considerations.

### Module 3 — Clutches, Brakes, and Springs

- Clutches: friction clutches; design considerations; multiple-disc; cone; centrifugal.
- Brakes: block, band, internal expanding shoe.
- Springs: classification; materials; stresses and deflection of helical springs; axial loading; curvature effect; resilience; static and fatigue loading; surging; critical frequency; end construction.
- Leaf springs: flat and semi-elliptical laminated; design of leaf springs.

### Module 4 — Gears

- Classification; gear nomenclature; tooth profiles; gear materials; law of gearing (review only); virtual/formative number of teeth.
- Gear tooth failures; beam strength; Lewis equation; Buckingham’s equation for dynamic load; wear load; endurance strength; surface durability; heat dissipation; lubrication.
- Merits and demerits of gear types; design of spur and helical gears.

### Module 5 — IC Engine Component Design

- Design of piston, cylinder, connecting rod, and flywheel.
