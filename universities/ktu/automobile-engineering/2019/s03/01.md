# MAT201: Partial Differential Equations and Complex Analysis

## Course Objectives

- Understand the concept and the solution of partial differential equations.
- Analyse and solve one-dimensional wave equation and heat equation.
- Understand complex functions and their continuity/differentiability using Cauchy–Riemann equations.
- Evaluate complex integrals using Cauchy’s integral theorem and Cauchy’s integral formula; understand series expansion of analytic functions.
- Understand the series expansion of complex functions about a singularity and apply residue theorem to compute real integrals.

## Modules

### Module 1 (Partial Differential Equations) — 8 hours

- Partial differential equations; formation by eliminating arbitrary constants and functions.
- Solutions of PDEs; equations solvable by direct integration.
- Linear first-order equations — Lagrange’s linear equation.
- Non-linear first-order equations — Charpit’s method.
- Solution by method of separation of variables.

### Module 2 (Applications of Partial Differential Equations) — 10 hours

- One-dimensional wave equation — vibrations of a stretched string; derivation.
- Solution of wave equation using separation of variables.
- D’Alembert’s solution of the wave equation.
- One-dimensional heat equation — derivation and solution.

### Module 3 (Complex Variable — Differentiation) — 9 hours

- Complex function, limit, continuity and derivative; analytic functions.
- Cauchy–Riemann equations; harmonic functions; finding harmonic conjugate.
- Conformal mappings: standard mappings w = z^2, w = e^z, w = sin z, w = 1/z.
- Linear fractional (Mobius) transformation w = (az + b)/(cz + d); fixed points; basic transformations.

### Module 4 (Complex Variable — Integration) — 9 hours

- Complex integration; line integrals in the complex plane; basic properties.
- Evaluation methods: (i) indefinite integration with substitution of limits, (ii) using a representation of a path.
- Contour integrals.
- Cauchy integral theorem (without proof) on simply- and multiply-connected domains.
- Cauchy integral formula (without proof); formula for derivatives of an analytic function.
- Taylor and Maclaurin series.

### Module 5 (Complex Variable — Residue Integration) — 9 hours

- Laurent’s series (without proof); zeros of analytic functions.
- Singularities: removable, poles and essential.
- Residues; Cauchy residue theorem (without proof).
- Evaluation of definite integrals using residue theorem.
- Residue integration of real integrals: integrals of rational functions of cos θ and sin θ; improper integrals of the form ∫\_{-∞}^{∞} f(x) dx with no poles on the real axis (cases where the integrand becomes infinite on the interval are excluded).
