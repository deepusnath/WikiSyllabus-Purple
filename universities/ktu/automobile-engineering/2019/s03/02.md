# MET201: Mechanics of Solids

## Course Objectives

- Determine the stresses, strains and displacements of structures by tensorial and graphical (Mohr’s circle) approaches.
- Analyse the strength of materials using stress-strain relationships for structural and thermal loading.
- Perform basic design of shafts subjected to torsional loading and analyse beams subjected to bending moments.
- Determine the deformation of structures subjected to various loading conditions using strain energy methods.
- Analyse column buckling and appreciate the theories of failures and its relevance in engineering design.
