- Wheels and Tyres: Types and construction; wheel dimensions; tyre structure and function; static/dynamic properties of pneumatic tyres; tyre types and materials; tyre section & designation; factors affecting tyre life; quick change and special wheels; troubleshooting.

### Module 2 - Front Axle and Steering Systems

- Types of front axles and stub axles.
- Front wheel geometry: castor, camber, king pin inclination, toe-in.
- Condition for true rolling during steering.
- Ackerman’s and Davis steering mechanisms; steering error curve.
- Steering linkages and gear types; slip angle; over-steer and under-steer.
- Reversible/irreversible steering; power-assisted steering.

### Module 3 - Propeller Shaft, Final Drive and Differential

- Propeller shaft: construction and types; universal joints (types); constant velocity joints.
- Final drive: construction details; types.
- Differential: principle; types of differential gears; conventional and non-slip differentials; backlash; differential lock; inter-axle differential; transaxle types.
- Rear axle: torque reaction and driving thrust; Hotchkiss and torque tube drive; axle shaft support — fully floating and semi-floating; axle housings.

### Module 4 - Brakes

- Necessity; stopping distance and time; brake efficiency; weight transfer; brake shoe theory.
