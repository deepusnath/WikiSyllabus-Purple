# AUT464: Aerospace Engineering

## Course Objectives

- Understand and analyze the structure and property variations of the atmosphere.
- Understand and evaluate basic aerodynamics (lift, drags, moments) and flow over aerofoils.
- Analyze aircraft dynamics and performance under take-off, cruise, landing, climb, glide, turn, and other maneuvers.
- Understand the working of different aircraft and rocket propulsion systems.
- Explain aircraft stability and control, wind tunnel testing, and flight instruments.
- Explain fundamentals of space travel.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Atmosphere, Similarity, and 2D Aerofoils

- Atmospheric layers: troposphere; stratosphere; thermosphere; ionosphere; standard atmosphere — pressure, temperature, density variations.
- Dimensional analysis; aerodynamic force; model study and similitude.
- 2D aerofoils: nomenclature and classification; pressure distribution in inviscid and real flows; momentum and circulation theories; characteristics.

### Module 2 — Lift, Drag, 3D Wings, and Propellers

- Lift, drag, and aerodynamic moments; dimensional analysis; drag types in aircraft.
- 3D/finite wings: wingtip vortices; horseshoe vortex system; lifting-line theory; load distribution; aspect ratio; induced drag (momentum method); skin-friction and form drag; planform changes.
- Propellers: momentum and blade-element theories; propeller coefficients and charts.

### Module 3 — Aircraft Performance

- Straight-and-level flight: power required vs available for propeller and jet aircraft.
- Climb and glide: rate of climb; service and absolute ceilings; glide angle and speed of flattest glide.
- Take-off and landing: runway length; ground run; ground effect.
- Turning/circling flight: radius of tightest turn.
- JATO/RATO; high-lift devices; range and endurance charts for piston and jet aircraft.

### Module 4 — Propulsion, Stability, and Instruments

- Aircraft power plants: IC engine–propeller; turboprop; turbofan; turbojet; ramjet; distributed propulsion (overview).
- Stability: static and dynamic; longitudinal; lateral; directional; controls of an airplane; aerodynamic and mass balancing of control surfaces (qualitative).
- Flight instruments: airspeed indicator; true airspeed calculation; altimeter; gyro horizon; direction indicator; vertical speed indicator; turn-and-bank indicator; air-temperature indicator.

### Module 5 — Wind Tunnels, Rockets, and Spaceflight Basics

- Wind tunnel testing: open- and closed-circuit tunnels; tunnel balances; supersonic tunnels.
- Rockets: principles; types and working (descriptive with figures assumed).
- Space travel fundamentals: Kepler’s laws; orbit equations; earth-orbiting and escape velocities (neglecting drag; circular orbit assumption).
