- Determine power‑plant performance under load variations.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Steam Power Plants

- General layout of steam power plants.
- Boilers: power‑plant boilers, critical and supercritical; fluidized‑bed boilers; boiler mountings and accessories.
- Systems: coal handling; pulverizers and burners; combustion systems; draft; ash handling; dust collection; feed‑water treatment; condensers and cooling towers; cooling ponds.
- Steam turbine performance and governing.
- Operation and maintenance; heat balance and efficiency; site selection of steam power plants.

### Module 2 — Diesel and Gas Turbine Power Plants

- Diesel power plants: general layout; components; performance; fuel, lubrication, air‑intake/admission, supercharging, exhaust systems; operation and efficiency; heat balance; site selection; comparison with steam plants.
- Gas‑turbine power plants: layout and elements; fuels; cogeneration; auxiliary systems (fuel, controls, lubrication); operation and maintenance.
- Combined‑cycle power plants; site selection; IGCC systems.

### Module 3 — Nuclear Power Plants

- Classification of nuclear fission reactors; layouts and subsystems.
- Reactor types: PWR, BWR, CANDU, sodium‑graphite, fast breeder (FBR), gas‑cooled, homogeneous and other reactor concepts.
- Principles for evaluating power reactors; safety measures.
- Role of computers in mathematical modelling of nuclear reactors.

### Module 4 — Hydroelectric and Non‑Conventional Power Plants

- Hydroelectric plants: classification; typical layouts and components.
- Principles of wind, tidal, solar PV and solar thermal, geothermal, biogas, and fuel‑cell power systems.

### Module 5 — Economics, Selection, and Environmental Issues

- Economics and selection: effect of plant type on costs; rates; fixed and energy elements; customer elements; investor’s profit; depreciation and replacement; theory of rates.
- Tariffs; load estimation; load‑distribution parameters; load curves; capital and operating cost of different plants; factors in power‑plant calculations.
- Effect of variable load on operation; selection of units.
- Energy control and environmental issues: generator cooling; transformer cooling; busbars; pollution‑control technologies and waste‑disposal options for coal and nuclear plants.
