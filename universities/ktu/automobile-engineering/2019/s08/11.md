# AUT436: Product Design and Lifecycle Management

## Course Objectives

- Familiarize with product design and development, scope, and opportunities.
- Understand product data management (PDM) functions and integration of environmental aspects in product design.
- Understand components and phases of product lifecycle management (PLM).
- Identify PLM drivers (external, internal, board-room) and their impact.
- Get familiar with PLM software and review case studies of PLM implementation across industries.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Product Design and Development Foundations

- Product design and development: classification/specifications of products; product life cycle; product mix.
- Modern product development process; innovative thinking; morphology of design.
- Conceptual design: generation, selection, and embodiment of concepts; product architecture.
- New product development (NPD): structuring NPD; decision support; estimating market opportunities; financial control; implementation; market entry; launch and tracking.
- Redesign concepts; industrial design: process and need.
- Robust design: Taguchi designs and DOE; design optimization.
- Engineering design organization/decomposition; product design process; methodical evolution; concurrent engineering; Design for X (DFX) and design-centric development model.
- End-of-life strategies: recovery, recycling; human factors in product design; modeling and simulation in product development.

### Module 2 — PDM and Environmental Integration in Design

- Product and product data: importance; range; parts/components/assemblies; identifiers; customer requirements to product specifications; identification standards; unique identifiers/keys; traceability.
- Collaborative product development.
- Integration of environmental aspects: sustainable development; Design for X systems/tools; Design for Disassembly; Design for Environment (DfE).
- Life Cycle Environmental Strategies (LCES): useful-life extension and end-of-life strategies; introducing environmental strategies into the design process.
- Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): properties and framework; phases per ISO standards; applications and limitations.
- Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA): general framework; evolution of product life-cycle cost models; case studies in LCA/LCCA.

### Module 3 — Components of PLM

- Product lifecycle stages: introduction, growth, maturity, decline.
- PLM: definition, overview, benefits; scope and PLM grid; corporate challenges and need for PLM; components/elements; steps and activities of a PLM initiative (case study).
- Phases and corresponding technologies: foundation (visualization, collaboration, EAI); core (data vaults, document/content management, workflow, program management); functional apps (configuration management).
- Human resources across the product lifecycle.
- PLM model: plan, design, build, support, dispose.
- PLM system architecture; information models and product structure; threads of PLM — CAD, EDM.

### Module 4 — PLM and Its Drivers; PDM and CIM

- Product Data Management (PDM): systems and importance; components; reasons for implementation; financial justification; barriers to implementation.
- Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) and weaving threads into PLM; comparison of PLM with ERP.
- PLM characteristics: singularity, cohesion, traceability, reflectiveness; information mirroring model.
- PLM drivers: external (scale, complexity, cycle times, globalization, regulation); internal (productivity, innovation, collaboration, quality); board-room (income, revenues, costs).

### Module 5 — Role of PLM in Industries and Case Studies

- PDM systems: importance; implementation reasons; financial justification; barriers.
- PLM selection and implementation case studies: automotive, aerospace, and other manufacturing sectors; other possible sectors.
- Components and phases of PLM in practice: feasibility study; visioning; strategy; change management; financial justification; ten-step approach to PLM.
- Benefits of PLM: business, organization, users, product/service, process performance.
- Case studies using leading commercial PLM/PDM software.
