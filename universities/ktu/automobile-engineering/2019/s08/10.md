# AUT426: Automotive Comfort and Safety Engineering

## Course Objectives

- Acquire theoretical knowledge of ergonomics in vehicle design.
- Understand driver information acquisition and processing.
- Understand the effects of body style on ingress/egress and usability.
- Learn vehicle evaluation methods and user-centered considerations.
- Understand automotive safety systems and testing methodologies.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Ergonomics and Occupant Package

- Ergonomics in vehicle design: system approach; research studies; engineer’s role; importance and implementation of ergonomics.
- Anthropometry: use in design; percentile calculations and application.
- Biomechanics application: seat design principles for comfort and support.
- Occupant package/seating package layout: design considerations; sequence of development; vehicle dimensions and SAE reference points.
- Driver package development procedures and common issues.

### Module 2 — Driver Information, Vision, and Visibility

- Driver information acquisition and processing: importance of time, generic information-processing model, human errors, psychophysics.
- Visual capabilities and other sensory modalities in driving.
- Field of view (FOV): types; forward FOV evaluation (up/down angles), short-driver problems, A‑pillar obstruction; mirror design issues.
- Methods to measure field of view and address other visibility issues.

### Module 3 — Ingress/Egress and Body Style Effects

- Entrance and exit from automobiles: common problems and design features/dimensions.
- Door handles and lateral sections; body opening clearance; hinge angles; seat bolsters — location and material choice.
- Tyres and rocker panels; running boards; third-row and rear-seat entry design.
- Heavy truck cab ingress/egress considerations and evaluation methods.
- Effects of body style on ingress/egress performance and usability.

### Module 4 — Vehicle Evaluation and User Studies

- Data collection and analysis methods for vehicle evaluation.
- Subjective methods: rating scales, paired comparison, Thurstone method.
- Application of evaluation techniques: checklists, observational studies, user interviews, driving-simulator studies, field studies.
- Understanding users: vehicle types, market segments, women and older drivers, geographic considerations; designing global vehicles.

### Module 5 — Automotive Safety and Crash Testing

- Automotive safety: passive vs active safety; seatbelts (three‑point); airbags — types and operation; crumple zones and passenger cage — functions and materials.
- Crash testing: human-subject history, crashworthiness concepts; deceleration curves (square wave), injury tolerance, deceleration control.
- Test methods: pole test, rollover test; compliance testing; component testing; in‑field testing.
