# AUT474: Metrology and Measurements

## Course Objectives

- Understand objectives of metrology, generalized measuring systems, and instrument characteristics.
- Describe principles and applications of instruments for linear, angular, taper, screw-thread, and gear-tooth measurements.
- Explain tolerances, limits, fits, allowances, and gauge types/design.
- Get exposure to advanced measuring instruments: CMM, machine vision, photogrammetry, and optical instruments.
- Describe functioning of force, torque, strain, vibration, velocity, acceleration, and temperature measurement devices.

## Modules

- Standards of measurement: material; wavelength; line and end standards; primary, secondary, tertiary, working standards.
- Errors in measurement: concepts; static and dynamic errors.
- Generalized measuring system stages: sensor–transducer; signal conditioning; readout/recording; input quantities.
- Static characteristics: accuracy; precision; calibration; threshold; sensitivity; hysteresis; repeatability; linearity; loading effect.
- Dynamic characteristics: order of systems and response; speed of response; measuring lag; fidelity; dynamic error.

### Module 2 — Dimensional and Geometric Measurements
