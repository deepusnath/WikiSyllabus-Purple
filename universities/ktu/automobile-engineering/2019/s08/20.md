- Design and analyze suspension systems using CAE tools.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Vehicle Frame

- Loads, moments, and stresses on frame members.
- Computer‑aided design and analysis of frames for passenger and commercial vehicles.

### Module 2 — Clutch and Gearbox

- Clutch torque capacity; computer‑aided design of clutch components; roller and sprag clutches — design details.
- Gearbox: finalization of gear ratios; computer‑aided design of 3‑speed and 4‑speed gearboxes.

### Module 3 — Driveline and Rear Axle

- Computer‑aided design of propeller shafts.
- Final drive gearing: design details.
- Full‑floating and semi‑floating rear shafts and axle housings: design details.

### Module 4 — Front Axle and Steering System

- Analysis of loads, moments, and stresses at different sections of the front axle.
- Determination of bearing loads at kingpin and wheel‑spindle bearings; bearing selection.
- Determination of optimum dimensions and proportions for steering linkages ensuring minimum steering error.

### Module 5 — Suspension

- Computer‑aided design and analysis of leaf springs, coil springs, and torsion bars.
- Analysis of hydraulic dampers using CFD software.
