# MAT202: Probability, Statistics and Numerical Methods

## Course Objectives

- Understand the concept, properties and important models of discrete random variables and, using them, analyse suitable random phenomena.
- Understand the concept, properties and important models of continuous random variables and, using them, analyse suitable random phenomena.
- Perform statistical inferences concerning characteristics of a population based on attributes of samples drawn from the population.
- Compute roots of equations, evaluate definite integrals and perform interpolation on given numerical data using standard numerical techniques.
- Apply standard numerical techniques for solving systems of equations, fitting curves on given numerical data and solving ordinary differential equations.

## Modules

### Module 1 (Discrete probability distributions) — 9 hours

- Discrete random variables and their probability distributions; expectation, mean and variance.
- Binomial distribution; Poisson distribution; Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution.
- Discrete bivariate distributions; marginal distributions.
- Independent random variables; expectation for multiple random variables.

### Module 2 (Continuous probability distributions) — 9 hours

- Continuous random variables and their probability distributions; expectation, mean and variance.
- Uniform, exponential and normal distributions.
- Continuous bivariate distributions; marginal distributions; independent random variables.
- i.i.d random variables and Central Limit Theorem (without proof).

### Module 3 (Statistical inference) — 9 hours

- Population and samples; sampling distribution of the mean and proportion (large samples only).
- Confidence interval for single mean and single proportion (large samples only).
- Tests of hypotheses (large sample): single mean and single proportion; equality of means and equality of proportions of two populations.
- Small sample t-tests: single mean of normal population; equality of means (pooled t-test for independent samples from two normal populations with equal variance).

### Module 4 (Numerical methods — I) — 9 hours

- Errors in numerical computation: round-off, truncation and relative error.
- Solution of equations: Newton–Raphson method and Regula–Falsi method.
- Interpolation: finite differences, Newton’s forward and backward difference methods, Newton’s divided difference method and Lagrange’s method.
- Numerical integration: Trapezoidal rule and Simpson’s 1/3rd rule (proof/derivation not required).

### Module 5 (Numerical methods — II) — 9 hours

- Solution of linear systems: Gauss–Seidel and Jacobi iteration methods.
- Curve fitting by least squares: fitting straight lines and parabolas.
- Solution of ODEs: Euler and classical Runge–Kutta methods of second and fourth order; Adams–Moulton predictor–corrector method (proof/derivation not required).
