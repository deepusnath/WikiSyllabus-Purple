# AUT301: Theory of Machines

## Course Objectives

- Understand the kinematics of planar mechanisms and the principles of brakes and clutches.
- Define cam terminologies and apply kinematic principles to sketch cam profiles for specified follower motions.
- Illustrate gear types and solve gear terminology and velocities in gear trains.
- Understand turning-moment diagrams, flywheel use, and demonstrate static/dynamic balancing for rotating and reciprocating parts.
- Build the basics of single- and multi-degree-of-freedom vibrations and their measurements.

## Modules
