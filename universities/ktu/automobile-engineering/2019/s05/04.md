# AUT307: Material Science and Metallurgy

## Course Objectives

- Understand atomic bonds and crystal structures (BCC, FCC, HCP) and their relationship with properties.
- Recognize solidification mechanisms and resulting defects.
- Analyse microstructures using phase diagrams and modify microstructure and properties via heat treatments.
- Define and differentiate engineering materials based on structure and properties for applications.
- Quantify mechanical integrity and failure in materials.

## Modules
