# AUT453: Design of Machine Elements

## Course Objectives

- Apply basic design methods for threaded and bolted joints.
- Apply basic design methods for riveted, cotter, and knuckle joints.
- Apply basic design methods for flat belts, V-belts, and welded joints.
- Apply basic design methods for roller chains and pressure vessels.
- Apply basic design methods for spur, helical, bevel, and worm gears.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Threaded and Bolted Joints

- Threaded joints: terminology; thread standards; types of threads; stresses in screw threads.
- Bolted joints: effect of initial tension; eccentric loading; design of bolts for static and fatigue loading; gasketed joints; power screws.

### Module 2 — Riveted, Cotter, and Knuckle Joints

- Riveted joints: materials; modes of failure; efficiency of joint; design of boiler and tank joints; structural joints.
- Cotter and knuckle joints: gib and cotter joint; analysis of knuckle joint.

### Module 3 — Belts and Welded Joints

- Design of flat belts: belt materials; slip and creep; centrifugal tension.
- Design of V-belt drives: advantages and limitations of V-belt drive.
- Design of welded joints: welding symbols; stresses in fillet and butt welds; butt joint in tension; fillet weld in tension; fillet joint under torsion; fillet weld under bending; eccentrically loaded welds.

### Module 4 — Roller Chains and Pressure Vessels

- Selection and power rating of roller chains; galling of roller chains; polygonal action; silent chain.
- Pressure vessels: thin cylinders; thick-cylinder equations; open and closed cylinders.

### Module 5 — Gear Design

- Design of spur gears; design of helical gears; design of bevel gears; design of worm and worm wheel.
