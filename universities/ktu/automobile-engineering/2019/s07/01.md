# AUT401: Advanced IC Engines

## Course Objectives

- Understand modern SI and CI engine combustion technologies; basics of dual-fuel and non-conventional engines.
- Get an overview of lean-burn engine concepts and operation.
- Understand stratified-charge engine principles and operation.
- Get exposed to low-temperature combustion (LTC) concepts, types, and strategies.

## Modules

### Module 1 — Advanced SI and CI Engines

- SI engines: review of combustion strategies; homogeneous-charge spark-ignition (HCSI); equivalence ratio and emissions; combustion duration; hydrogen in SI engines; emission-control devices in modern SI engines.
- CI engines: review of combustion strategies; high-pressure CRDI; components — pump, rail, pressure sensor, pressure control valve; electronic injectors (types, pulse width, duty cycle); multiple injection diesel combustion; UPCR; turbochargers (types, components); cold and hot EGR; emission-control devices — TWC, SCR, DPF, DOC; urea injection/AdBlue.

### Module 2 — Dual-Fuel, Multi-Fuel, and Alternative Engines

- Dual-fuel engine concepts and significance; factors affecting combustion; performance of dual-fuel engines.
- Multi-fuel engines: characteristics and performance.
- CNG and LNG engines: direct-injection natural gas technologies; applications; strengths and weaknesses; CNG conversion and future trends.
- Non-conventional engines: Wankel, Stirling, free-piston, VCR, flex-fuel (FFV).

### Module 3 — Lean Burn and Gas Turbines

- Lean-burn fundamentals; lean-burn SI engines; combustion and emissions; lean-limit operations.
- Extending lean limit in SI engines: increased turbulence; partial stratification; microwave-assisted spark ignition; LNT technology.
- Gas turbines: components and working; gas turbines as automotive engines; limitations; comparison with IC engines.

### Module 4 — Stratified Charge and Advanced GDI Concepts

- Stratified-charge combustion in DI SI engines: methods of charge stratification; GDI combustion process; turbocharged DI SI (TSI) — challenges, advantages, trends.
