## Modules

### Module 1 — Refrigeration Cycles and Refrigerants

- Refrigeration: COP; vapour compression system — practical cycle; effect of superheating, subcooling, condenser and evaporator pressures on COP.
- Trans-critical cycle; ejector refrigeration cycle; P–h and T–s charts.
- Refrigerants: classification — CFC, HCFC, HFC, azeotropic, zeotropic, natural and secondary refrigerants; antifreeze solutions; phase-change materials.
- Desired properties and requirements; safety classification; refrigerant oils and applications; properties and uses of commonly used refrigerants.
- Environmental impact: greenhouse effect; global warming; future refrigerants such as hydrofluoro-olefins (HFOs).

### Module 2 — Heating and Ventilation Systems

- Heating systems: warm air; hot water; steam heating; panel and central heating systems.
