# PECET865: Design of Earthquake Resistant Structures

## Course Objectives

- Apply basic seismic concepts and building code provisions to seismic design.

- Understand dynamic behavior of structures and ductile detailing principles.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Dynamics of Structures

- Classification of dynamic loads and system components.

- SDOF systems: equation of motion, free vibration (damped/undamped).

- Logarithmic decrement and harmonic loading response.

- Dynamic magnification factor.

### Module 2: Seismic Response and MDOF Systems

- Base excitation and response of SDOF systems.

- Response spectrum concepts: pseudo acceleration, DVA plots.

- MDOF systems: equations, mode shapes, orthogonality.

- Modal expansion and superposition method.

### Module 3: Earthquake Engineering and Building Response

- Plate tectonics, faults, magnitude, seismic waves.

- Seismographs and seismic zone mapping.

- Lateral load resisting systems in RC and steel.

- Building irregularities and torsional effects.

- Seismic coefficient method using IS 1893.

- Response spectrum method (concept only).

- Ductility and detailing per IS 13920.

- Rapid Visual Screening Technique.

### Module 4: Project-Based Seismic Design

- Course project: computer modeling, seismic analysis, ductile detailing.

- Evaluation criteria: objectives, data collection, analysis, verification, final design.
