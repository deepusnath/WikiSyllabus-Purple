# OECET834: Fundamentals of Building Planning

## Course Objectives

- Enable students to develop creative and sustainable building design.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Architectural Principles

- Definition and historical development of architecture.
- Principles of architectural composition: unity, harmony, character, balance, proportion, scale, rhythm, accentuation, contrast.
- Organizing principles: symmetry, hierarchy, axis, linear, concentric, radial, asymmetric grouping, primary and secondary masses.

### Module 2: Form, Space & Acoustics

- Form and space: positive/negative space, horizontal/vertical elements, qualities of architectural space.
- Architectural design process: 7 phases from pre-design to construction administration.
- Acoustics fundamentals: intensity, decibel scales, sound level addition.
- Acoustical defects: echoes, reverberation, foci, dead spots, loudness, noise.
- Sound absorption: materials and fixings.

### Module 3: Lighting & Thermal Comfort

- Natural lighting: visual task requirements, units of light, daylight factor, standards.
- Thermal comfort: effective temperature, indices, bioclimatic chart, psychrometry.
- Earth-Sun relationship and solar angles.

### Module 4: Safety & Sustainability

- Thermal design: thermo-physical properties, thermal control.
- Fire protection: causes, spread mechanisms, classification, material combustibility.
- Anthropometrics: space requirements, movement diagrams, activity-space relationships.
- Energy efficiency: assessment, green building rating guidelines.
