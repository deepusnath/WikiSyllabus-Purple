- Emphasize sustainable transportation and its integration with urban development.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Urban Transport

- Need for transportation planning.

- Characteristics of urban travel, challenges, and environmental impacts.

- Urban structure types: centripetal, grid, linear, directional.

- Movement and accessibility, hierarchy of transport facilities.

- Demand analysis and consumer behavior modeling.

### Module 2: Planning Process and Data Collection

- Systems approach and stages of planning.
