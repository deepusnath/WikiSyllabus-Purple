# OECET832: Rainwater Harvesting

## Course Objectives

- Familiarize students with the key components of rainwater harvesting systems.

- Impart knowledge on hydrologic phenomena and their relevance in water conservation.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Rainwater Harvesting

- Hydrologic cycle and advantages of rainwater.

- Factors affecting runoff from catchment.

- Water storage and recharge essentials.

- Components of rainwater harvesting: catchment area, harvesting structures, soil moisture conservation, check dams, artificial recharge, farm ponds, percolation tanks.

### Module 2: Water Harvesting Techniques

- Principles, importance, and issues in water harvesting.

- Classification based on source, storage, and use.

- Rainwater harvesting methods: direct use and groundwater recharge.

- Modular systems: mesh/leaf screen, gutter, downspout, first flush device, sand and charcoal filters.

### Module 3: Subsurface Aquifer Recharge

- Recharge methods: pit, abandoned hand pump, dug/open well, trench, shafts.

- Recharge trench with bore.

### Module 4: Artificial Recharge and Watershed Concepts

- Artificial recharge: concept and methods (basin, stream, ditch, furrow, flooding, recharge wells, mounds, induced recharge).

- Watershed development: need, planning, drainage, and management for rainwater harvesting.
