# PECET864: Advanced Design of Steel Structures

## Course Objectives

- Enhance and strengthen knowledge on detailed design methods for steel structures.

- Ensure compliance with Indian codes in structural steel design.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Bolted Connections

- Types of bolts: bearing and high-strength.

- Prying force and beam-to-column connections.

- Design of seat angles (unstiffened and stiffened).

- Web angle and end plate connections.

- Beam and column bolted splices.

- Framed beam and continuous beam-to-beam connections.

### Module 2: Welded and Tubular Connections

- Structure and properties of weld metal.

- Beam-to-column connections: stiffened beam seat, web angle, end plate.

- Tubular connections: in-plane joint parameters.

- Welds in tubular joints and curved weld lengths.

### Module 3: Plate Girders

- Design of plate girders under uniformly distributed loads.

- Design of stiffeners.

### Module 4: Gantry and Light Gauge Structures

- Gantry girders: loading, selection, moving load effects, deflection limits.

- Design profile and structural layout.

- Light gauge steel structures: cross sections, materials.

- Buckling of thin elements, stiffened compression elements.

- Tension members, beam deflection, combined stresses, connections.
