# PECET637: Traffic Engineering and Management

## Course Objectives
- Impart in-depth knowledge pertinent to traffic flow theory, traffic management measures, capacity analysis and road safety.
- Enable designing of road intersections and traffic signals.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Traffic Flow and Regulations
- Parameters: speed, density, volume, travel time, headway, spacing.
- Time-space diagram, time mean speed, space mean speed.
- Fundamental diagrams and flow models: Greenshields, Greenberg, multi-regime.
- Traffic regulations: Motor Vehicle Act, speed limits, vehicle and driver rules, parking.
- Traffic management: turn restrictions, one-way streets, tidal flows, bus lanes.

### Module 2: Intersections and Traffic Control
- At-grade intersections: forms, conflict points, visibility triangles, design, channelization.
- Grade-separated intersections: 3-leg, 4-leg, multi-leg interchanges.
- Traffic signs, road markings, and control aids (general awareness only).

### Module 3: Capacity and Level of Service
- Concepts: base vs adjusted capacity, LOS definition and influencing factors.
- Homogeneous vs heterogeneous traffic, PCU concept.
- LOS analysis: single, intermediate, and two-lane roads using Indo-HCM 2017.
- Urban roads: capacity analysis with Indo-HCM 2017.
- Roundabouts: geometric layout, types, design elements.

### Module 4: Signals and Safety
- Signal types: pre-timed, traffic actuated; warrants.
- Design: phase planning, Webster's method, pedestrian phase, timing diagram.
- Road safety: accident causes, driver/vehicle/road factors, pedestrian safety.
- Data analysis: collision and condition diagrams.
- Road safety audit: concept, need, involved organizations, stages.
