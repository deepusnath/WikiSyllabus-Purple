## Course Modules

### Module 1: Surface Irrigation and Crop Water Needs
- Surface irrigation methods: border, basin, furrow types; design parameters; evaluation.
- Ideal wetting patterns and efficiency.
- Crop water requirement: infiltration, ET, effective rainfall, irrigation scheduling.
- Soil-water-plant relationship and yield response.

### Module 2: Distribution Systems and Drainage Needs
- Irrigation distribution methods: canal regulation, supply vs demand-based delivery.
- Scheduling criteria, frequency and interval constraints.
- Performance indicators, rehab strategies, and modernization.
- Land drainage systems: necessity, types, design considerations.

### Module 3: Soil Water Zone and Drainage Theory
- Physical properties: conductivity, storativity, leakage factor.

- Equations and analysis: Laplace, continuity, Dupit-Forchheimer theory.
- Recharge scenarios and water table dynamics.

### Module 4: Drainage System Design & Salinity Control
- Open and pipe drainage systems: layout, types, design under various flow conditions.
- Drainage criteria: crop season, salt drainage, off-season.
- Salt balance and leaching requirement.
- Salinity equations in EC terms and gravity outlet design.
