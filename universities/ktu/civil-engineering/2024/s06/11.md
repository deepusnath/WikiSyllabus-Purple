## Course Modules

### Module 1: Construction Materials
- Mortar—types, properties, and applications.
- Timber products—plywood, fibreboard, particleboard uses.
- Cement—manufacturing, composition, and IS-specified tests.
- Aggregates—gradation, bulking of fine aggregate.
- Reinforcing and structural steel—types and specifications.
- Admixtures—mineral (fly ash, GGBS) and chemical (plasticizers, super plasticizers, etc.).

### Module 2: Concrete Technology
- Concrete production—batching to curing.
- Properties of fresh concrete—workability, slump test, segregation, bleeding.
- Hardened concrete—strength factors, compression/tension/flexure tests.
- Quality control—statistical analysis, standard deviation, mix proportioning (BIS), nominal mixes.

### Module 3: Building Construction
- Foundation types—shallow vs. deep.
- Masonry—stone types and construction.
- Lintels and arches—design and details.
- Tall buildings—framed construction in steel/concrete.
- Prefabrication and slip-form technology—principles and practice.

### Module 4: Construction Technology and Trends
