# PECET634: Repair and Rehabilitation of Structures

## Course Objectives
- To understand the basic idea about the need of maintenance, repair, rehabilitation and strengthening measures of building structures.
- To identify various deterioration mechanisms or damage mechanisms in buildings.
- To study various non-destructive techniques and semi destructive techniques for the damage diagnosis and assessment of a structure at the site.
- To be aware of several practices for maintenance and rehabilitation like surface repair, corrosion protection, structural strengthening etc.
- To suggest evaluation and repair/maintenance methods for extending the service life of buildings.
- To recognize various demolition methods.

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Damage Diagnosis and Assessment
- Importance of routine and preventive maintenance, rehabilitation, repair, retrofit and strengthening.
- Need for rehabilitation of structures.
- Cracks in RC buildings and masonry structures: causes and effects.
- Inspection and assessment procedures: visual inspection, damage evaluation.

### Module 2: Testing and Surface Preparation
- Non-destructive testing: rebound hammer, ultrasonic pulse velocity.
- Semi-destructive testing: probe test, pull-out test, chloride penetration, carbonation, corrosion measurement, core test.
- Strength and durability: climate effects, corrosion, cover thickness, quality assurance.
- Substrate preparation methods, reinforcement cleaning.

### Module 3: Repair Materials and Techniques
- Repair materials: selection criteria and methodology, health & safety precautions.
- Special concretes: polymer, sulphur-infiltrated, FRC, HPC, SCC, self-healing, geopolymer, reactive powder, industrial-waste based.
- Mortars and compounds: expansive cement, gunite, shotcrete, ferrocement.
- Grouting: types and chemicals, applications.
- Crack repair methods: grouting, sealing, stitching, packing, overlays, autogenous healing.

### Module 4: Strengthening and Demolition
- Corrosion mechanisms and cathodic protection techniques.
- Jacketing: beam, column, beam-column joint, RC, steel, FRP.
- Structural strengthening after fire, leakage, earthquake: epoxy injection, shoring, underpinning.
- Demolition techniques: non-explosive and explosive, engineered demolition (wrecking ball, saw cutting, top-down, hydraulic crusher, implosion).
