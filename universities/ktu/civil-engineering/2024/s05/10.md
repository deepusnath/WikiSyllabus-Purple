# PECET526: Applied Hydrology and Climatology

## Course Objectives
- To expose the students to the fundamental concepts of groundwater hydrology and its engineering applications.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Hydrometeorology and Precipitation
- Weather vs Climate; Hydrometeorological variables.
- Humidity, vapor pressure, saturation vapor pressure-temperature relation.
- Perceptible water, forms/types of precipitation; cloud types.
- Monsoon patterns, Indian summer rainfall characteristics.
- Climate oscillations and their effect on monsoon.
- Evapotranspiration estimation: Blaney-Criddle method, Penman method, Penman-Monteith method.

### Module 2: Climate Change and Catchment Dynamics
- Causes and impacts of climate change.
- Hydrologic modeling frameworks, General and Regional Circulation Models.
- Downscaling: concepts and types.
- Catchment characteristics.
- Stream classification, patterns, and stream order.

### Module 3: Statistical Hydro-Climatology
- Principal Component Analysis for climate studies.
- Methods: Change point analysis, trend analysis (statistical & graphical).
- Stationarity vs non-stationarity of hydro-climatic time series.

### Module 4: Flood Estimation and Routing
- Design flood estimation methods.
- Flood frequency analysis: Gumbel's method.
- Flood routing: hydrologic vs hydraulic.
- Reservoir routing (concept only), channel routing via Muskingum method.
- Determining Muskingum parameters.
- Flood control: forecasting and warning systems.
