## Course Modules

### Module 1
- **Basic Principles of Open Channel Flow:** Introduction to the legal system, constitution, acts, rules, and regulations. Basic principles of fluid mechanics: continuity, momentum, energy, and Bernoulli principles with application to open channels.

### Module 2
- **Uniform Flow:** Types of flow, velocity distribution, and coefficients. Uniform flow, gradually varied flow, and rapidly varied flow (RVF). Open channel design, including the effects of mutual interaction of interconnected channels.

### Module 3
- **Gradually Varied Flow:** Derivation and numerical solutions of the unsteady flow equations. Simplified methods of flow routing.

### Module 4
- **Hydraulic Structures:** Design of hydraulic structures, including dams, weirs, and spillways. Hydraulic design of culverts. Flow measurement in open channels and spatially varied flow.
