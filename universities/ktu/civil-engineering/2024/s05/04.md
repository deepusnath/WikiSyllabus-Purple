- To understand the basics of water resources engineering.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1
- **Hydrologic cycle:** Precipitation, mechanism, types, forms and measurement using rain gauges, Optimum number of rain gauges, representation of rainfall data-mass curve and hyetograph, computation of mean precipitation over a catchment, Design rainfall, probable maximum rainfall, IDF curves (conceptual idea only).

### Module 2
- **Runoff:** Factors affecting runoff, computation of runoff-empirical formulae, rainfall-runoff correlation, unit hydrograph, derivation of unit hydrograph from isolated storm, S-hydrograph, storm/flood hydrograph of different duration by method of superposition and by development of S-hydrograph, Floods-methods of design flood estimation - Empirical methods, SPF and PMF, Return period (conceptual ideas only).

### Module 3
- **Irrigation:** Necessity, benefits and ill effects. Types: flow and lift irrigation - perennial and inundation irrigation. Soil-water-plant relationships. Irrigation efficiencies, Computation of crop water requirement: depth and frequency of Irrigation. Duty and delta, duty-factors affecting.
- **River Training Works:** Types; Meandering and meander parameters.
- **Reservoirs:** Types, zones, yield of reservoir, determination of storage capacity and yield by mass curve method. Reservoir sedimentation and control- trap efficiency, computation of life of reservoir.

### Module 4
- **Groundwater Hydrology:** Ground water: types of aquifers -confined, unconfined and leaky aquifers, Aquifer parameters - Transmissibility, Storativity, Specific yield and Specific retention, Darcy's law, steady flow towards a well in a confined aquifer-Dupuit's equation.
- **Well Hydraulics:** Steady flow towards a well in an unconfined aquifer.
- **Tube wells:** Different types, well construction and well losses, pumping test, well interference.
- **Artificial recharge of groundwater:** methods.
