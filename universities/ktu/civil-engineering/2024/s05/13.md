# PECET525: Design of Prestressed Concrete

## Course Objectives
- Learn the design of prestressed concrete elements.
- Understand the principles, systems, and materials used in prestressed concrete structures.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Introduction and Analysis
- Concept and types of prestressing.
- Advantages and limitations.
- Prestressing systems and anchorage devices.
- Materials: high-strength concrete and steel.
- Stress–strain characteristics.

### Module 2: Losses and Flexural Design
- Losses in prestress: elastic shortening, friction, anchorage slip, creep, shrinkage, steel relaxation.
- Total prestress loss.
- Flexure design: ultimate strength, preliminary and final design for Type 1 members.

### Module 3: Deflections and Shear Design
- Deflections due to gravity and prestress force.
- Total deflection limits.
- Span-to-depth ratio guidance.
- Shear design: failure modes, shear resistance components, design of transverse reinforcement.

### Module 4: Detailing and Special Designs
- Design of end block using latest IS codes.
- Anchorage systems.
- Conceptual design of prestressed decks.
- Composite sections: prestressed beam with cast-in-situ slab.
