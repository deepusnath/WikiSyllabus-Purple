# PECET521: ADVANCED STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

## Course Objectives
- This course provides the fundamental concepts of three hinged arches and matrix analysis of structures, specifically on direct stiffness method.
- This course equips students with the concepts of finite element methods, which in turn is the basis of many structural analysis software, and a brief idea on the concept of structural dynamics.

## Course Modules

### Module 1
- **Two hinged Arches:** Analysis of two hinged arches, Support reactions, normal thrust and radial shear at any section of a parabolic arch due to simple cases of loading, influence line for horizontal thrust, bending moment, normal thrust, and radial shear.
- **Matrix Analysis of Structures:** Reviewing the definition of flexibility and stiffness influence coefficients, and concepts of physical approach.

### Module 2
- **Direct stiffness method:** Introduction to direct stiffness method, Rotation of axes in two dimensions, stiffness matrix of elements in global coordinates from element co-ordinates, assembly of load vector and stiffness matrix, analysis of rigid frames (beams and portal frames) with sway.

### Module 3
- **Finite Element Method:** Introduction, basics of finite element method, types of elements, shape functions for bar, beam and truss elements.
- **Introduction to Structural Dynamics:** Single degree of freedom systems.

### Module 4
- **Structural Dynamics:** Free vibration of single degree of freedom systems, Natural period of vibration, Damped vibrations, critical damping, Logarithmic decrement, Forced vibrations.
- **Continuous Beams:** Analysis of continuous beams with different moment of inertia for different spans.
