## Course Modules

### Module 1: Planning & Exploration

- Necessity, scope and objectives of investigation.

- Planning subsurface exploration—factors and IS guidelines.

- Techniques: open pits, trenches, shafts, auger boring, wash boring, percussion, rotary drilling.

- Soil sampling: disturbed vs. undisturbed, representative, chunk, tube samples.

### Module 2: Penetration & Sounding Methods

- Standard Penetration Test (SPT): procedure, corrections, correlations.

- Static Cone Penetration Test: merits, limitations, property mapping.

- Dynamic CPT: comparison with SPT and SCPT.

- Plate Load Test: methodology, application, limitations.

### Module 3: Field & Geophysical Testing

- Electrical Resistivity: profiling & sounding—applications and limits.

- Pressure Meter Test and Pile Load Test: procedures and interpretation.

### Module 4: Sampling, Reporting & Geosynthetics

- Area ratio, clearance ratio, recovery ratio—sampler types: thin-walled, piston, split spoon.

- Handling & transport protocols, underwater sand sampling methods.

- Presentation: bore logs, soil profiles, structured investigation reports.

- Functions and applications of geosynthetics: pavements, railways, erosion control—Kerala case studies.
