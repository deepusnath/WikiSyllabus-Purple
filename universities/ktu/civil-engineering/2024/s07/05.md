# PECET746: Highway Materials and Design

## Course Objectives

- Understand the characteristics and testing methods of highway materials.

- Design durable bituminous mixes for better pavement performance.

- Analyze pavement stresses and design flexible and rigid pavements using different approaches.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Pavements & Material Testing

- Flexible and rigid pavements—component layers and functions.

- Desirable properties of subgrade soil, road aggregates, bitumen.

- Testing principles and procedures for all key materials.

### Module 2: Bituminous Mixes & Design

- Durable pavement materials: artificial aggregates, binders (emulsions, cutbacks, modifiers).

- Bitumen aging and related tests.

- Mix specifications, grading of aggregates.

- Bituminous mix design using Marshall Method.

### Module 3: Flexible Pavement Design

- Analysis and design of flexible pavements—factors influencing performance.

- ESWL, EWL factors, stresses and deflections.

- Empirical, semi-empirical, and theoretical methods: CBR, Triaxial, Burmister’s two-layer theory, IRC method.

### Module 4: Rigid Pavement Design

- Stress types: wheel load, warping, frictional—Westergaard’s analysis.

- Cement concrete pavement joints: types, spacing, tie and dowel bar design (IRC).

- Slab thickness design using IRC guidelines.
