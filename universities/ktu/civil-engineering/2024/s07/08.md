## Course Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of groundwater hydrology and its engineering applications.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Aquifer Basics and Flow

- Vertical distribution of groundwater, geologic formations, aquifers and types.

- Properties of aquifers—storage and transmissivity, Darcy’s law review.

- Steady unidirectional flow in homogenous aquifers, recharge impacts.

- Flow into infiltration galleries and related problem sets.

### Module 2: Aquifer Evaluation & Numerical Modelling

- Aquifer parameter evaluation—Theis, Jacob’s, Chow’s methods.

- Groundwater flow modelling—governing equations and boundary conditions.

- Solving 1D steady flow (confined/unconfined) with finite difference method.

### Module 3: Well Construction & Hydraulics

- Unsteady radial flow to wells—PDE formulations.

- Image well system, method of images—practical cases and calculations.

- Shallow well construction: cable tool, rotary, reverse rotary methods.

- Gravel packed well design, development, and rehabilitation techniques.

### Module 4: Investigations & Contamination

- Surface groundwater investigation—electrical resistivity, seismic refraction.

- Aquifer thickness determination for horizontal aquifers.

- Groundwater contamination, water quality—graphical representation.

- Sea water intrusion: Ghyben-Herzberg theory, interface estimation, preventive actions.
