# PECET741: Structural Dynamics

## Course Objectives

- Provide fundamental concepts of structural dynamics for analyzing dynamic behavior of structures.

- Develop theoretical background to model and perform dynamic analysis under various loading conditions.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Basics of Dynamic Systems

- Classification of dynamic loads and essential characteristics.

- Discretization methods; Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) systems.

- Equation of motion formulation: Newton’s law & D’Alembert’s principle.

- Undamped and damped free vibration; critical, over- and under-damped cases.

- Logarithmic decrement and harmonic loading response.

- Steady state amplitude, dynamic magnification, transmissibility, vibration isolation.

### Module 2: General Loading Response

- Response to periodic loading using Fourier series.

- Impulse load response: half-sine, rectangular, triangular pulses.

- General loading response: Duhamel Integral for damped/undamped systems.

### Module 3: Multi Degree Systems

- Lumped mass and shear building models.

- Equation of motion and free vibration analysis.

- Natural frequencies and mode shapes; orthogonality of normal modes.

- Approximate methods: Rayleigh, Dunkerley, Stodola.

### Module 4: Continuous Systems

- Distributed mass systems and motion equations.

- Axial vibration of rods; flexural vibration of beams.

- Natural frequencies and mode shapes of simply supported, cantilevered, and fixed beams (formulation only).
