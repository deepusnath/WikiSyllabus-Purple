## Course Modules

### Module 1: River Systems and Behavior

- River morphology, stream classification systems.

- Channel geometry, supercritical flow profiles.

- Bed material, bank erosion, degradation, aggradation.

- Long contraction effects and stream behavior.

### Module 2: River Training Works

- Objectives and classification of training works.

- Planning and design parameters—embankments, guide banks, artificial cut-offs.

- River diversions, pitched islands—real-world applications.

- River basin management plans, inter-basin transfers, water disputes.

### Module 3: Sediment Transport and Mechanics
