# PECET745: Pavement Design and Construction

## Course Objectives

- Introduce fundamental concepts of pavements, construction materials, and types.

- Enable students to analyze, design, and evaluate pavements using standard procedures.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Pavement Structure & Materials

- Pavement types: flexible vs. rigid—layers, functions, characteristics.

- Pavement materials: aggregate, bitumen, subgrade soil.

- Testing methods: aggregate, bitumen, and soil (CBR).

- Bitumen types, emulsions, cutbacks, grading techniques.

### Module 2: Mix Design & Pavement Types

- Bituminous pavement systems: penetration, premixed.

- Special layers: stone mastic, mastic asphalt.

- Mix design: physical and volumetric properties.

- Marshall method, Superpave overview.

### Module 3: Pavement Construction Practices

- Construction steps and quality checks for flexible pavements:

  - Subgrade, GSB, WBM, WMM, Bituminous Macadam & Concrete.

- Cement concrete pavement construction:

  - Subgrade prep, base layers, reinforcement placement, slab construction.

### Module 4: Pavement Evaluation Techniques

- Functional and structural requirements.

- Pavement condition survey and distress rating.

- Structural evaluation via Benkelman Beam Deflection.
