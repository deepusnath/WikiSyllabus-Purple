# PECET743: Environmental Geotechnology

## Course Objectives

- Provide understanding of soil–water–contaminant interaction processes.

- Explore design aspects of waste containment facilities.

- Study methodologies for remediation of contaminated sites.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Geoenvironmental Engineering

- Scope and multidisciplinary aspects—soil physics, chemistry, hydrogeology, biology.

- Multiphase behavior of soil and geochemical attenuation processes.

- Soil–water–contaminant interactions and double layer theory.

- Environmental influence on soil properties: Atterberg limits, strength, volume change, permeability.

- Contaminant transport mechanisms: advection, diffusion, dispersion, sorption—Fick's law.

### Module 2: Solid Waste Characterization and Management

- Characteristics of municipal solid waste: physical, chemical, geotechnical.

- Identification of hazardous vs. non-hazardous waste.

- Environmental impacts of waste dumps and regulatory overviews: MOEF&CC, SWM rules.

- Waste facility siting via environmental impact assessment.

### Module 3: Landfills and Containment Systems

- Landfill types, layout, and capacity planning.

- Liner and cover systems: natural clay, compacted clay—permeability testing methods.

- Leachate and gas collection systems: passive vs. active approaches.

- Closure and post-closure monitoring practices.

### Module 4: Remediation and Geosynthetics

- Site exploration and risk assessment of contaminated sites.

- In-situ and ex-situ remediation techniques: bioremediation, thermal, pump and treat, phytoremediation, electrokinetic.

- Landfill stability (introductory).

- Geosynthetics in landfill design: geotextiles, geomembranes, clay liners, geocomposites—construction and testing methodologies.
