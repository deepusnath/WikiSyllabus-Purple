## Course Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Surveying
- **Introduction to Surveying:** Principles, Linear, angular and graphical methods, Survey stations, Survey lines- ranging, Bearing of survey lines, Local attraction, Declination, Methods of orientation (by compass and by back sighting).
- **Levelling:** Principles of levelling, Dumpy level, booking and reducing levels, Methods (simple, differential, reciprocal, profile, and cross sectioning), Digital and Auto Level, Errors in levelling.
- **Contouring:** Characteristics, methods, uses.

### Module 2: Areas, Volumes and Triangulation
- **Areas and Volumes:** Computation of area by offsets to base line and by dividing area into a number of triangles; volume of level section by prismoidal and trapezoidal formulae.
- **Mass diagram:** Construction, characteristics and uses.
- **Triangulation:** Triangulation figures, Triangulation stations, Inter visibility of stations, Satellite Stations and reduction to centre.

### Module 3: Theory of Errors and Advanced Surveying Instruments
- **Theory of Errors:** Types, theory of least squares, weighting of observations, most probable value, computation of indirectly observed quantities (method of normal equations).
- **Total Station:** Concept of EDM, principles and working, advantages and applications.
- **Global Positioning Systems (GPS):** Components and principles, satellite ranging-calculating position, signal structure, application of GPS, GPS Surveying methods (Static, Rapid static, Kinematic methods, DGPS).
- **Recent trends in Surveying:** GNSS, Smart Station and LIDAR.

### Module 4: Remote Sensing and GIS
- **Remote Sensing:** Definition, Electromagnetic spectrum, Energy interactions with atmosphere and earth surface features, spectral reflectance of vegetation, soil and water, classification of sensors (Active and Passive), Resolution (spatial, spectral radiometric and Temporal), Multi spectral scanning (Along track and across track scanning).
- **Geographical Information System (GIS):** Components of GIS, GIS operations, Map projections (methods), Coordinate systems (Geographic and Projected), Data Types (Spatial and attribute data, Raster and vector data representation).
