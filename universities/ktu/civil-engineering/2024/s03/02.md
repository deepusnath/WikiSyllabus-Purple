## Course Modules

### Module 1: Fluid Properties and Statics
- Fluid properties, Newton's law of viscosity, types of fluids (description only).
- Fluid Statics: Fluid pressure, Pascal's Law, Hydrostatic law, Measurement of fluid pressure using manometers (Simple and Differential), and Mechanical gauges.
- Determination of total pressure and center of pressure on various surfaces (Vertical, Horizontal, inclined, and curved).

### Module 2: Buoyancy and Floatation
- Basic concepts, center of buoyancy, meta-center and meta-centric height of floating bodies.
- Determination of meta-centric height using analytical and experimental methods.
- Conditions for stability of floating and submerged bodies.

### Module 3: Fluid Kinematics and Dynamics
- Fluid Kinematics: Methods of describing fluid motion (Lagrangian and Eulerian), types of fluid flow, continuity equation in one, two, and three dimensions.
- Determination of velocity and acceleration, streamline, pathline and streakline, velocity potential, stream function and flow net.
- Fluid Dynamics: Forces in fluid motion, Derivation of Bernoulli's equation from Euler's equation of motion.
- Practical Applications of Bernoulli's equation: Venturimeter, orifice meter and Pitot tube.
- Momentum equations and forces on Pipe bends.

### Module 4: Flow through Orifices, Pipes, and Open Channels
- Flow through Orifices: Hydraulic coefficients, discharge through large orifices (rectangular).
- Pipe flow: Major losses (Darcy Weisbach equation) and minor losses in pipes.
- Hydraulic gradient line and total energy line, pipes in series and parallel, equivalent pipes.
- Flow in Open channel: Comparison between pipe flow and open channel flow, classification of flow in open channels.
- Flow through Notches and Weirs: Classification, discharge over rectangular, triangular, and trapezoidal notches/weirs, velocity of approach and end contraction.
