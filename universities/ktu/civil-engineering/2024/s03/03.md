# PCCET303: Structural Analysis - 1

## Course Objectives
1. To provide students with a thorough understanding of the fundamental theory of structural analysis.
2. To develop the student's ability to both model and analyse statically determinate and indeterminate structures and to provide realistic applications encountered in professional practice.

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Statically Determinate Trusses, Cables and Suspension Bridges
- Statically determinate trusses: Analysis using method of joints and method of sections.
- Cables and Suspension bridges: Forces in loaded (concentrated and uniformly distributed) cables, length of cables, supports at same and different levels, maximum tension in the suspension cable and backstays, pressure on towers.
- Simple suspension bridges with three hinged stiffening girders - bending moments and shear force diagrams.
- Deformation Response of Statically Determinate Beams: Moment area method (Mohr's theorems), Applications to determinate deformations of cantilever and simply supported beams (prismatic and beams of varying cross section) subjected to concentrated and uniformly distributed loads.

### Module 2: Deformation Response & Energy Principles
- Deformation Response of Statically Determinate Beams: Conjugate beam method (Real beam and conjugate beam, boundary conditions), Applications to determinate deformations of cantilever and simply supported beams (prismatic and beams of varying cross section subjected to concentrated and uniformly distributed loads).
- Energy Principles and Energy Theorems: Castigliano's theorem I, Principle of virtual work, Betti's theorem, Maxwell's law of reciprocal deflections.
- Unit load method for determination of deflection of statically determinate beams, frames and trusses.

### Module 3: Indeterminate Structures
- Introduction to force method of analysis, Static indeterminacy, Analysis of statically indeterminate structures.
- Castigliano's theorem II, Minimum strain energy method for analysing statically indeterminate structures (illustration only).
- Method of consistent deformations: Analysis of beams, frames and trusses (simple problems with one redundant, illustration only for two-redundant problems).
- Concepts of effect of pre-strain, lack of fit, temperature changes and support settlement (illustration only).

### Module 4: Three Hinged Arches, Moving Loads and Influence Lines
- Three Hinged Arches: Action of an arch, Eddy's theorem.
- Three hinged, parabolic and circular arches (with supports at same level), determination of horizontal thrust, bending moment, normal thrust and radial shear.
- Moving Loads and influence lines: Introduction to moving loads, concept of influence lines.
- Influence lines for reaction, shear force and bending moment in simply supported beams and over hanging beams, analysis for different types of moving loads (single concentrated load, several concentrated loads, uniformly distributed load shorter and longer than the span), conditions for maximum bending moment and shear force.
