# PECET414: CARTOGRAPHY AND GIS

## Course Objectives
- To develop a comprehensive understanding of maps, map scales, projections, and GIS principles.
- To gain practical skills in map interpretation, design, and production using modern cartographic methods.
- To acquire skills in acquiring, managing, and analysing spatial data using GIS software and spatial databases.
- To explore applications of geospatial technologies in revisualization, multimedia cartography, and location-based services.
