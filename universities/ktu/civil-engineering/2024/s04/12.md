## Course Modules

### Module 1
- **Definition of architecture:** Historical development of architecture.
- **Principles of architectural composition:** Unity/harmony, character, balance, proportion, scale, rhythm, accentuation and contrast.
- **Organising principles in architecture:** Symmetry, hierarchy, axis, linear, concentric, radial and asymmetric grouping, primary and secondary masses.
- **Form and Space in architecture:** Positive and negative space, defining space with horizontal and vertical elements, qualities of architectural space.
- **Architecture Design Process:** The 7 phases: The pre-design phase, The schematic design phase, The design development phase, The construction documents phase, The building permit phase, The bidding and negotiation phase, The construction administration phase.

### Module 2
- **Acoustics, fundamentals:** Intensity of sound (Watts/m2, Bel, Decibel scales, dBA, Phon), addition of sound levels.
- **Acoustical Defects:** Echoes, Reverberation, Foci and Dead Spots, Loudness, Noise.
- **Acoustics, applications:** Recommended sound levels for interiors, Air and structure born noises, measures of noise control, Source-path and receiving end, TL value and computation of TL value, Flanking paths.
- **Sound absorption:** materials and fixings. Reverberation: Sabines formula, Eyrings modification.

### Module 3
- **Natural lighting:** Visual task requirements, Units of Light, Light, Vision and Buildings, Standards of Lighting and Visual comfort, The sky as a source of light, Daylight factor, Recommended daylight factors for interiors. Design of side-lit windows using Daylight factor graphs.
- **Artificial lighting:** illumination requirements (lux meter), lamps and luminaries, polar distribution curves. Design of artificial lighting: lumen method, point by point method.
- **Thermal comfort:** Factors affecting thermal comfort, effective Temperature, Thermal comfort indices (ET, CET Charts), Bioclimatic chart, Psychrometry and Psycrometric chart.
- **Earth-Sun relationship:** Sun's apparent movement with respect to the earth, Solar angles. Computation of solar radiation on different surfaces, solar path diagram, shadow-throw concept and design of shading devices.
