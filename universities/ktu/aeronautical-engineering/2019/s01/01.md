# MAT201: Linear Algebra and Calculus

## Course Objectives
* To equip students with the fundamental concepts of linear algebra and multivariable calculus.
* To enable students to solve systems of equations and perform matrix operations including diagonalization and classification of quadratic forms.
* To develop the ability to analyze and interpret multivariable functions using derivatives, integrals, and series.
* To build a strong foundation in convergence of infinite series and applications of Taylor and Fourier series in engineering problems.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Solve systems of linear equations, diagonalize matrices and characterise quadratic forms. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
* **CO 2:** Compute the partial and total derivatives and determine maxima and minima of multivariable functions. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
* **CO 3:** Compute multiple integrals and apply them to find areas and volumes of geometrical shapes, mass and centre of gravity of plane laminas. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
* **CO 4:** Perform various tests to determine whether a given series is convergent, absolutely convergent or conditionally convergent. *(Cognitive level: Analyze)*
* **CO 5:** Determine the Taylor and Fourier series expansion of functions and learn their applications. *(Cognitive level: Understand and Apply)*
