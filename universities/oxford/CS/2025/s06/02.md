## Overview

Computer Networks provides comprehensive coverage of network architectures, protocols, and distributed systems. The course examines the TCP/IP protocol stack, network routing algorithms, and modern networking technologies. Students learn to design and analyze network systems while understanding performance, security, and reliability considerations. This course is essential for careers in network engineering, distributed systems, and cloud computing.

## Learning Objectives
