## Overview

Databases provides comprehensive coverage of database system design, implementation, and management. The course covers relational database theory, SQL programming, transaction processing, and modern database technologies. Students learn to design efficient database schemas and implement robust data management systems. This course is essential for careers in software development, data engineering, and enterprise system design.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand fundamental database concepts including data models and schema design
- Master relational algebra and SQL for database querying and manipulation
- Apply normalization theory to design efficient database schemas
- Implement transaction processing and concurrency control mechanisms
- Analyze database performance and optimization techniques
- Explore modern database technologies including NoSQL and distributed systems

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Database Fundamentals**
- Database concepts and data models
- Relational model and relational algebra
- SQL basics: queries, joins, and aggregation

**Module 2: Database Design**
- Entity-relationship modeling
- Functional dependencies and normalization
- Advanced SQL: views, triggers, and stored procedures

**Module 3: Transaction Processing**
