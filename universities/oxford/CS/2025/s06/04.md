## Overview

The Third-Year Project allows students to undertake substantial independent research or development work under academic supervision. Students choose from theoretical research, software development, or interdisciplinary projects that demonstrate mastery of computer science principles. This project counts as two courses and provides opportunity for in-depth exploration of specialized areas. The project develops research skills, technical expertise, and professional presentation abilities essential for graduate study or industry careers.

## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate independent research and problem-solving capabilities
- Apply computer science knowledge to substantial real-world or theoretical problems
- Develop project management and time management skills for long-term technical work
- Master technical writing and presentation skills for academic and professional audiences
- Critically evaluate existing work and contribute novel insights or implementations
- Reflect on ethical and societal implications of computer science research and development

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Project Planning and Literature Review**
- Project proposal development and supervisor consultation
- Comprehensive literature review and background research
- Methodology selection and project planning
- Risk assessment and timeline development

**Module 2: Implementation and Development**
- Core project implementation or research investigation
- Regular progress meetings with supervisor
- Iterative development and testing phases
- Documentation and version control practices

**Module 3: Analysis and Documentation**
- Results analysis and evaluation
- Comprehensive project report writing
- Oral presentation preparation
- Project demonstration and defense

**Module 4: Advanced Development and Refinement**
- Extended implementation or deeper theoretical analysis
- Integration testing and validation
- Final report completion and submission
- Public presentation of findings

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is based on the final project report, oral presentation, and project demonstration. Students work independently with regular supervisor meetings and progress reviews. The project requires substantial time commitment equivalent to two standard courses. Assessment criteria include technical quality, originality, project management, and communication effectiveness.
