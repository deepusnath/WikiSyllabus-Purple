## Overview

Computational Complexity provides a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the computational resources required to solve algorithmic problems. The course covers complexity classes, reducibility, completeness theory, and advanced topics in theoretical computer science. Students develop skills in formal analysis and proof techniques for understanding fundamental computational limitations. This course is essential for theoretical computer science research and provides deep insights into algorithmic efficiency.
