## Overview

Information Theory provides mathematical foundations for understanding information, communication, and computation. This Schedule B2 course covers entropy, mutual information, channel capacity, and coding theory. Students explore fundamental limits of data compression and reliable communication while developing skills in probabilistic analysis. The course bridges computer science, mathematics, and engineering with applications to cryptography, machine learning, and communication systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand fundamental concepts of information entropy and mutual information
- Master mathematical techniques for analyzing information-theoretic problems
- Apply coding theory principles to data compression and error correction
- Analyze channel capacity and fundamental limits of communication systems
- Explore connections between information theory and machine learning
- Develop skills in probabilistic modeling and asymptotic analysis
