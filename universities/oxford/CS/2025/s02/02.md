## Overview

Design and Analysis of Algorithms introduces systematic approaches to solving computational problems efficiently. The course covers fundamental algorithmic paradigms including divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming. Students learn to analyze algorithm complexity using asymptotic notation and develop skills in algorithm design and correctness proofs. This course builds upon discrete mathematics and programming fundamentals to establish the theoretical foundation for advanced computer science topics.

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental algorithmic design paradigms and their applications
- Analyze algorithm complexity using Big-O, Omega, and Theta notation
- Design efficient algorithms for classic computational problems
- Prove algorithm correctness using mathematical techniques
- Understand space-time trade-offs in algorithm design
- Apply algorithmic thinking to solve novel computational challenges

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Algorithm Analysis and Asymptotic Notation**
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Big-O, Omega, and Theta notation
- Recurrence relations and the Master theorem

**Module 2: Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms**
- Merge sort, quick sort, and selection algorithms
- Binary search and its variants
- Closest pair and other geometric algorithms

**Module 3: Greedy Algorithms**
- Activity selection and scheduling problems
- Minimum spanning trees (Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms)
- Huffman coding and compression techniques

**Module 4: Dynamic Programming**
- Optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems

- Matrix chain multiplication and edit distance

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted as part of the four examination papers at the end of Year 1. Algorithm design and analysis content is examined in Paper 3 alongside other core computer science subjects. Students complete weekly algorithmic problem sets and engage in tutorial discussions focusing on algorithm design techniques and complexity analysis.
