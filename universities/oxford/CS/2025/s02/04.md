## Overview

Probability provides the mathematical foundation for understanding uncertainty and randomness in computational systems. The course covers probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, and statistical inference. Students learn to model stochastic processes and analyze probabilistic algorithms. This course is essential for machine learning, artificial intelligence, cryptography, and performance analysis of computer systems, building upon discrete mathematics to provide tools for reasoning about uncertain events.

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental probability theory and probability spaces
- Work with discrete and continuous random variables and their distributions
- Apply Bayes' theorem and conditional probability to solve problems
- Understand expectation, variance, and moments of random variables
- Analyze probabilistic algorithms and their expected performance
- Connect probability theory to applications in computer science and machine learning

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Foundations of Probability**
- Sample spaces, events, and probability axioms
- Conditional probability and independence
- Bayes' theorem and applications

**Module 2: Discrete Random Variables**
- Probability mass functions and cumulative distribution functions
- Common discrete distributions: binomial, Poisson, geometric
- Expectation and variance calculations

**Module 3: Continuous Random Variables**
- Probability density functions and continuous distributions
- Normal, exponential, and uniform distributions
- Central limit theorem and law of large numbers

**Module 4: Applications to Computer Science**
- Probabilistic algorithms and randomized complexity
- Markov chains and random walks
- Applications to cryptography and machine learning

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted as part of the four examination papers at the end of Year 1. Probability content is examined in Paper 2 alongside continuous mathematics and other mathematical subjects. Students engage with weekly problem sheets emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical applications, with tutorials focusing on problem-solving techniques and computational applications.
