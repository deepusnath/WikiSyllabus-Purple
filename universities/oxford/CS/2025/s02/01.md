## Overview

Continuous Mathematics extends the mathematical foundations from discrete structures to continuous domains, essential for computer graphics, machine learning, and scientific computing. The course covers calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and numerical methods. Students develop analytical skills for modeling continuous phenomena and understanding optimization problems. This course complements discrete mathematics by providing tools for algorithm analysis involving continuous functions and geometric transformations.

## Learning Objectives

- Master differential and integral calculus for single and multivariable functions
- Understand linear algebra concepts including vector spaces, matrices, and eigenvalues
- Apply calculus to optimization problems and constraint satisfaction
- Solve basic differential equations and understand their applications in computer science
- Develop numerical methods for approximating solutions to continuous problems
- Connect continuous mathematical concepts to computational algorithms and data analysis

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Differential Calculus**
- Limits, continuity, and derivatives
- Chain rule, product rule, and implicit differentiation
- Applications to optimization and curve sketching

**Module 2: Integral Calculus**
- Definite and indefinite integrals
- Fundamental theorem of calculus
- Integration techniques and applications

**Module 3: Multivariable Calculus**

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted as part of the four examination papers at the end of Year 1. Continuous Mathematics content is examined in Paper 2 alongside other mathematical subjects. Students complete weekly problem sets focusing on computational techniques and theoretical understanding, with tutorials emphasizing applications to computer science problems.
