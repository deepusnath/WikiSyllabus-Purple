## Overview

Functional Programming introduces students to the functional programming paradigm, emphasizing immutable data, higher-order functions, and declarative problem-solving approaches. The course primarily uses Haskell to explore concepts such as recursion, pattern matching, type systems, and lazy evaluation. Students develop skills in mathematical reasoning about programs and learn to write elegant, correct, and efficient functional code. This course complements imperative programming by providing alternative approaches to software design and implementation.

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental functional programming concepts and techniques
- Write recursive functions and understand the role of immutability
- Utilize higher-order functions and function composition effectively
- Understand type systems, polymorphism, and type inference
- Apply pattern matching and algebraic data types to solve problems
- Develop skills in program verification and mathematical reasoning about code

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Introduction to Functional Programming**
- Basic Haskell syntax and REPL usage
- Functions, expressions, and immutable values
- Recursion and recursive data structures

**Module 2: Lists and Higher-Order Functions**
- List processing and common list functions
- Map, filter, fold, and function composition
- Lambda expressions and partial application

**Module 3: Type Systems and Algebraic Data Types**
- Haskell's type system and type inference
- Custom data types and pattern matching
- Polymorphism and type classes

**Module 4: Advanced Functional Concepts**
- Lazy evaluation and infinite data structures
- Monads and functional I/O
- Program correctness and equational reasoning

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted as part of the four examination papers at the end of Year 1. Functional Programming content is examined in Paper 4 alongside other programming subjects. Students complete weekly programming exercises in Haskell, focusing on implementing algorithms functionally and proving properties of their programs through tutorials and practical sessions.
