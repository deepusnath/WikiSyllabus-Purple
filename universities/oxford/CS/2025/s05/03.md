## Overview

Computer Security provides comprehensive coverage of security principles, threats, and defense mechanisms in computer systems. The course examines cryptographic foundations, network security protocols, system security design, and security management practices. Students learn to identify vulnerabilities, design secure systems, and implement security controls. This course is essential for understanding modern cybersecurity challenges and developing secure software and systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand fundamental security principles including confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- Master cryptographic techniques including symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Analyze security protocols for authentication and secure communication
- Identify common security vulnerabilities in software and systems
- Design and implement security controls and access management systems
- Evaluate security risks and develop comprehensive security policies

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Security Foundations**
- Security principles and threat modeling
- Risk assessment and security policies
- Access control models: DAC, MAC, RBAC

**Module 2: Cryptography**
- Symmetric encryption: DES, AES
- Asymmetric encryption: RSA, elliptic curves
- Hash functions and digital signatures

**Module 4: Network and Protocol Security**
- Network security threats and attacks
- Secure communication protocols: TLS/SSL
- Authentication protocols and key management

**Module 5: System and Application Security**
- Operating system security mechanisms
- Software security: buffer overflows, injection attacks
- Secure software development practices

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted through written examination as part of the Part B final examinations. Students complete practical exercises in cryptographic implementation and security analysis. Coursework includes vulnerability assessment projects and security protocol analysis using industry-standard tools.
