## Overview

Artificial Intelligence provides a comprehensive introduction to core AI techniques and methodologies. The course covers fundamental topics including search algorithms, knowledge representation, reasoning under uncertainty, machine learning basics, and intelligent agents. Students explore both theoretical foundations and practical applications of AI systems. This course prepares students for advanced study in machine learning, robotics, and cognitive computing while developing skills essential for modern AI development.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand fundamental AI concepts including intelligent agents and problem-solving
- Master search algorithms including uninformed and informed search strategies
- Apply knowledge representation techniques using logic and probabilistic methods
- Implement reasoning systems for handling uncertainty and incomplete information
- Analyze basic machine learning algorithms and their applications
- Design and evaluate AI systems for real-world problem domains

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Intelligent Agents and Problem Solving**
