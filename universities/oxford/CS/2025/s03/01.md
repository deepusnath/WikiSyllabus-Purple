## Overview

An introduction to the principles and practice of compilers, covering lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation. Students learn to construct compilers for simple programming languages, understanding the translation process from high-level source code to executable machine code. This course provides essential knowledge for understanding how programming languages are implemented.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the phases of compilation and their interconnections
- Implement lexical analyzers using finite automata and regular expressions
- Design and implement parsers using context-free grammars
- Perform semantic analysis including type checking and symbol table management
- Generate intermediate and target code for simple programming languages
- Optimize code at various levels of the compilation process

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Lexical Analysis**
- Regular expressions and finite automata
- Lexical analyzer generators

**Module 2: Syntactic Analysis**
- Context-free grammars and parsing
- Top-down and bottom-up parsing techniques
- Parser generators

**Module 3: Semantic Analysis**
- Symbol tables and type checking
- Attribute grammars

**Module 4: Code Generation**
- Intermediate code generation
- Target machine code generation
- Basic optimization techniques

## Assessment & Workload

16 lectures delivered in Michaelmas Term. Assessment typically includes practical implementation exercises and written examination. Workload involves significant programming components building compiler components.
