## Overview

Elective course from Schedule A1 providing foundational knowledge in probability theory essential for computer science applications. Students learn probability distributions, random variables, and statistical inference methods. This mathematical foundation supports later studies in machine learning, algorithms analysis, and system performance modeling.

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental concepts of probability theory
- Work with discrete and continuous probability distributions
- Understand random variables and their properties
- Apply probability to solve computational problems
- Use statistical methods for data analysis
- Connect probability theory to computer science applications

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Basic Probability**
- Sample spaces, events, and probability axioms
- Conditional probability and independence

**Module 2: Random Variables**
- Discrete and continuous random variables
- Probability mass and density functions

**Module 3: Distributions**
- Common probability distributions
- Expected value and variance

**Module 4: Statistical Inference**
- Estimation and hypothesis testing
- Applications in computer science

## Assessment & Workload

Delivered in Michaelmas Term as part of Schedule A1 options. Assessment includes problem sheets with mathematical calculations and proofs, plus written examination focusing on probability theory applications.
