## Overview

An exploration of fundamental mathematical models used to describe computation, including finite automata, regular languages, context-free grammars, and Turing machines. Students examine the theoretical foundations of computer science, learning about computability, decidability, and complexity theory. This course bridges discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand various models of computation and their capabilities
- Work with finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines
- Analyze regular and context-free languages using formal methods
- Explore concepts of computability and decidability
- Investigate time and space complexity classes
- Apply mathematical rigor to computational problems

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Finite Automata and Regular Languages**
- Deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata
- Regular expressions and pumping lemma

**Module 2: Context-Free Languages**
- Context-free grammars and pushdown automata
- Parsing and language recognition

**Module 3: Turing Machines**
