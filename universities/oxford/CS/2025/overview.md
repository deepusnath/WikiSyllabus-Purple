# Oxford Computer Science (BA/MCompSci) - 2025

## Degree Overview

The University of Oxford Computer Science degree offers a comprehensive four-year program leading to either a BA (three years) or Master of Computer Science (MCompSci) (four years). The course provides strong theoretical foundations while maintaining practical relevance, preparing students for research or industry careers in computing.

## Degree Structure

### BA Computer Science (3 years)
- **Year 1 (S1-S2)**: Core foundation subjects including mathematics, programming, and theoretical computer science
- **Year 2 (S3-S4)**: Core computer science topics with introduction to optional subjects (Part A)
- **Year 3 (S5-S6)**: Specialized study through optional subjects and project work (Part B)

### MCompSci (4 years)
- **Years 1-3**: Same as BA program
- **Year 4 (S7-S8)**: Advanced study with specialized optional subjects and a substantial individual project (Part C)

## Year-by-Year Mapping

### Year 1 (S1-S2): Foundation
Core subjects include:
- Continuous mathematics
- Design and analysis of algorithms
- Digital systems
- Discrete mathematics
- Functional programming
- Imperative programming
- Introduction to proof systems
- Linear algebra
- Probability

### Year 2 (S3-S4): Part A
**Core subjects (50%):**
- Algorithms and data structures
- Compilers
- Concurrent programming
- Models of computation
- Group design practical

**Optional subjects (50%)** from Schedule A1 and A2

### Year 3 (S5-S6): Part B
Students choose 6-8 optional subjects from Schedules B1 and B2, with optional project work

### Year 4 (S7-S8): Part C (MCompSci only)
Students take 5 advanced optional subjects from Schedule C1 plus a major individual project

## Assessment Structure

- **Year 1**: Four exam papers
- **Year 2**: Eight exam papers plus practical assessment
- **Year 3**: Six exam papers plus project report, or eight exam papers
- **Year 4**: Five take-home exams/written papers plus project report

## Progression Requirements

To progress from BA to MCompSci (Year 4), students must achieve a 2:1 or higher classification at the end of Year 3.
