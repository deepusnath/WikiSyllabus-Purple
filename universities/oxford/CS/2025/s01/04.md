## Overview

Introduction to Proof Systems develops logical reasoning and formal proof techniques essential for theoretical computer science. The course covers propositional and predicate logic, natural deduction, and formal proof systems. Students learn to construct rigorous mathematical arguments and understand the foundations of automated reasoning and theorem proving. This course provides the logical foundation for understanding program verification, formal methods, and computational logic used throughout computer science.

## Learning Objectives

- Master propositional logic including syntax, semantics, and truth tables
- Understand predicate logic with quantifiers and their interpretation
- Construct formal proofs using natural deduction and other proof systems
- Apply logical reasoning to verify program correctness and mathematical statements
- Understand the relationship between syntax and semantics in formal systems
- Develop skills in automated reasoning and theorem proving techniques

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Propositional Logic**
- Syntax and semantics of propositional logic
- Truth tables and logical equivalences
- Normal forms and satisfiability

**Module 2: Predicate Logic**
- First-order logic syntax and semantics
- Quantifiers and their properties
- Unification and substitution

**Module 3: Natural Deduction**
- Introduction and elimination rules
- Constructing formal proofs
- Proof strategies and tactics

**Module 4: Applications and Advanced Topics**
- Program verification and Hoare logic
- Introduction to automated theorem proving
- Modal logic and temporal logic basics

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted as part of the four examination papers at the end of Year 1. Proof Systems content is examined in Paper 1 alongside other theoretical foundations. Students complete weekly exercises in proof construction and participate in problem-solving sessions to develop logical reasoning skills.
