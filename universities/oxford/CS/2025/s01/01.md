## Overview

Discrete Mathematics provides the mathematical foundations essential for computer science, focusing on discrete structures rather than continuous ones. The course covers fundamental topics including sets, functions, relations, logic, proof techniques, combinatorics, and graph theory. Students develop rigorous mathematical thinking and proof-writing skills that underpin all areas of theoretical computer science. This course forms the mathematical backbone for algorithms, complexity theory, and formal methods studied in later years.

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental discrete mathematical structures including sets, relations, and functions
- Develop proficiency in various proof techniques including direct proof, proof by contradiction, and mathematical induction
- Understand propositional and predicate logic, including truth tables and logical equivalences
- Apply combinatorial principles to counting problems and probability calculations
- Analyze graph structures and apply graph algorithms to solve problems
- Write clear, rigorous mathematical proofs and arguments

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Sets, Relations, and Functions**
- Set theory, operations, and Venn diagrams
- Relations: equivalence relations and partial orders
- Functions: injective, surjective, and bijective mappings

**Module 2: Logic and Proof Techniques**
- Propositional logic and truth tables
- Predicate logic and quantifiers
- Direct proof, proof by contradiction, and proof by contraposition

**Module 3: Mathematical Induction**
- Principle of mathematical induction
- Strong induction and well-ordering principle
- Applications to algorithms and data structures

**Module 4: Combinatorics and Counting**
- Basic counting principles and permutations
- Combinations and binomial coefficients
- Inclusion-exclusion principle and advanced counting

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted as part of the four examination papers at the end of Year 1. Discrete Mathematics content is examined in Paper 1 alongside other foundational subjects. Students are expected to engage with weekly problem sheets and attend small group tutorials to develop problem-solving skills and proof-writing abilities.
