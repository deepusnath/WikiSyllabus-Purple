## Overview

Digital Systems introduces the fundamental principles of digital logic and computer hardware design. The course covers Boolean algebra, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, and basic computer architecture. Students learn how digital computers work at the hardware level, from basic logic operations to processor design. This foundation is essential for understanding computer architecture, embedded systems, and the relationship between software and underlying hardware implementations.

## Learning Objectives

- Master Boolean algebra and logic gate operations
- Design and analyze combinational logic circuits
- Understand sequential circuits including flip-flops and state machines
- Apply digital design principles to solve practical problems
- Understand basic computer architecture and processor design
- Design simple digital systems using hardware description languages

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates**
- Boolean functions and truth tables
- Basic logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR
- Logic gate implementation and circuit analysis

**Module 2: Combinational Logic Design**
- Karnaugh maps and logic minimization
- Multiplexers, decoders, and encoders
- Arithmetic circuits: adders and comparators

**Module 3: Sequential Logic Systems**
- Latches and flip-flops
- Counters and shift registers
- State machines and state diagrams

**Module 4: Computer Architecture Basics**
- CPU organization and instruction execution
- Memory systems and addressing
- Introduction to hardware description languages

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted as part of the four examination papers at the end of Year 1. Digital Systems content is examined in Paper 2 alongside other systems topics. Students complete practical exercises in circuit design and simulation, working with digital design tools and hardware description languages.
