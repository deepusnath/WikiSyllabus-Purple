## Overview

Imperative Programming introduces students to fundamental programming concepts using an imperative programming paradigm. The course covers basic programming constructs, data structures, and algorithm implementation techniques. Students learn to write, debug, and analyze programs while developing good programming practices and style. The course typically uses languages like Java or C to teach core concepts including variables, control structures, arrays, and object-oriented principles that form the foundation for all subsequent programming courses.

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental programming constructs including variables, loops, and conditional statements
- Understand and implement basic data structures such as arrays, lists, and simple objects
- Develop proficiency in debugging techniques and error handling
- Apply problem-solving skills to decompose complex problems into manageable programming tasks
- Write well-structured, readable, and maintainable code following good programming practices
- Understand basic concepts of object-oriented programming including classes and methods

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Programming Fundamentals**
- Variables, data types, and basic input/output
- Arithmetic and logical operators
- Control structures: if-statements and loops

**Module 2: Functions and Procedures**
- Function definition and calling conventions
- Parameter passing and return values
- Scope and lifetime of variables

**Module 3: Arrays and Data Structures**
- One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
- String manipulation and processing
- Introduction to collections and basic data structures

**Module 4: Object-Oriented Concepts**
- Classes, objects, and encapsulation
- Methods and constructors
- Basic inheritance and polymorphism concepts

## Assessment & Workload

Assessment is conducted as part of the four examination papers at the end of Year 1, with practical programming components examined in Paper 2. Students complete weekly programming exercises and participate in practical sessions in computer laboratories. Regular coursework includes programming assignments that build progressively in complexity.
