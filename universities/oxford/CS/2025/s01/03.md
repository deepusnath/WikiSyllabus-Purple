## Overview

Linear Algebra provides essential mathematical foundations for computer science applications including computer graphics, machine learning, and numerical algorithms. The course covers vector spaces, matrices, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. Students develop computational skills in matrix operations while understanding the theoretical underpinnings that support advanced topics in computer vision, optimization, and data analysis. This mathematical framework is crucial for understanding algorithms in graphics, machine learning, and scientific computing.
