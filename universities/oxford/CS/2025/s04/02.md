## Overview

Core course introducing principles and practice of concurrent and parallel programming. Students learn about threads, synchronization, communication between processes, and the challenges of writing correct concurrent software. This course addresses fundamental concepts essential for modern multi-core and distributed computing systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand concepts of concurrency and parallelism
- Implement thread-based and process-based concurrent programs
- Use synchronization primitives to coordinate concurrent execution
- Identify and solve common concurrency problems
- Apply concurrent programming patterns and best practices
- Analyze the performance and correctness of concurrent systems

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1: Introduction to Concurrency**
- Processes, threads, and parallel execution models
- Shared memory vs. message passing

**Module 2: Synchronization**
- Mutual exclusion and critical sections
- Semaphores, monitors, and locks

**Module 3: Concurrent Programming Problems**
- Deadlock, livelock, and starvation
- Producer-consumer and readers-writers problems

**Module 4: Advanced Topics**
- Lock-free programming and atomic operations
- Concurrent data structures and performance

## Assessment & Workload

16 lectures delivered in Hilary Term. Assessment includes practical programming assignments focusing on concurrent program implementation and written examination covering theoretical concepts and problem-solving techniques.
