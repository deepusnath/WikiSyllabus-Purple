# MG2CCRBCA102 - Operating Systems

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of operating systems (OS), focusing on their design, functionality, and core components. Students will explore fundamental concepts, including process management, scheduling, synchronization, memory management, and strategies to handle deadlocks and virtual memory.

## Course Objectives

* Describe the structure, types, and services of an operating system.
* Analyse the performance of various process scheduling algorithms.
* Appraise various techniques for process synchronization and deadlock handling.
* Analyse the methods employed for memory management in computer systems.
