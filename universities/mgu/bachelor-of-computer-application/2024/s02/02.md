# MG2CCRBCA101 - Data Structures

This course module offers a comprehensive introduction to data structures and its applications. It covers foundational topics such as algorithms, arrays, stacks, queues, recursion, and linked lists. It also covers advanced concepts like hashing, graphs, and tree structures, including AVL trees.

## Course Objectives

* Understand the fundamental concepts of Data Structures, the representation of single and two-dimensional arrays, and the implementation of various operations on them.
* Analyse the representation of stacks and queues using arrays, operations on them, and the application of these data structures in problem-solving.
* Demonstrate the ability to implement and manipulate various types of linked lists (singly, doubly, and circular).
* Illustrate the basic concepts of Graphs and Trees and the operations on Binary search trees.
* Implement Data Structures using the C programming language.
