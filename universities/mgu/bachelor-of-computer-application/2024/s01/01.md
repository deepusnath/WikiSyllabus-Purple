# MG1DSCBCA100 - Fundamentals of Programming Using C

This course covers fundamental concepts in computer programming, including algorithms, flowcharts, programming languages, control flow structures, arrays, and functions, emphasizing practical implementation through a series of hands-on exercises. Students will gain proficiency in solving problems using the C programming language.

## Course Objectives

* Demonstrate basic programming concepts.
* Understand C Programming Basics such as Datatypes and Variables, and different types of operators.
* Devise C programs using the concept of Decision statements and loop control statements.
* Apply logic to use arrays and functions in the C Programming Language.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Problem Solving and Introduction to Programming
* *Problem Solving Life Cycle:* Understanding and Analysing the Problem Statement, Program design using Hierarchy charts, Top-down and Bottom-up approaches.
* *Problem-Solving Tools:* Algorithms and Flowcharts (Definitions, attributes, symbols), Statements (Input-Output, Decision-Making & Looping).
* *Introduction to Programming:* Computer programs, classification of computer languages, language translators (Assembler, Compiler, Interpreter), Linker, testing, and debugging.

### Module 2: C Language Fundamentals
* *Tokens:* C Character Set, Delimiters, Types of Tokens, C Keywords, Identifiers, Constants, and Variables.
* *Data Types and Variables:* Rules for defining variables, C data types, declaring and initializing variables, type modifiers, and type conversion.
* *Operators and Expressions:* Properties and priority of operators, comma, conditional, arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators.

### Module 3: Input/Output and Control Flow
* *Input and Output:* Formatted and unformatted functions, commonly used library functions.
* *Decision Statements:* `If`, `if-else`, nested `if-else`, `if-else-if` ladder, `break`, `continue`, `goto`, and `switch`.
* *Loop Control:* `for` loops, nested `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do-while` loop.

### Module 4: Arrays, Functions, and Structures
* *Arrays:* Initialization, terminology, one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays and operations.
* *Strings and Pointers:* Introduction to strings, standard functions, and pointers.
* *Functions:* Basics of a function, definition, return statement, types of functions, call by value and reference, and recursion.
* *Storage and Structures:* Storage class, `Structure` and `union`, declaration and initialization of structures, `typedef`, and enumerated data types.
