# CA2CRT05 - Object Oriented Programming using C++

---
## Course Objectives

* Understand the core concepts of OOP and the basic structure of a C++ program.
* Define classes and objects, and use member functions, static members, and friend functions.
* Implement constructors, destructors, and overload unary and binary operators.
* Apply different types of inheritance to create class hierarchies.
* Use pointers, virtual functions for polymorphism, and perform file I/O operations.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Principles of OOP and Beginning with C++
* *OOP Concepts:* Procedure Oriented vs. Object Oriented Programming. Basic concepts of OOP, its benefits, and applications.
* *C++ Basics:* Structure of a C++ program, data types, operators, control structures, and functions (inline, default arguments, overloading).

### Module 2: Classes and Objects
* *Class Design:* Specifying a class, defining member functions, nesting of member functions, private members. Arrays within a class, memory allocation for objects, static data members and member functions, arrays of objects, objects as function arguments, friendly functions, and returning objects.

### Module 3: Constructors, Destructors, and Overloading
* *Constructors/Destructors:* Constructors (Default, Parameterized, Copy, Multiple, Dynamic) and Destructors.
* *Overloading:* Operator overloading (Unary and Binary), overloading with friends, and type conversion.

### Module 4: Inheritance
* *Derived Classes:* Defining derived classes with different visibility modes.
* *Types of Inheritance:* Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical, and Hybrid inheritance. Virtual base classes, abstract classes, and constructors in derived classes.

### Module 5: Pointers, Virtual Functions, Polymorphism, and Files
* *Pointers & Polymorphism:* Pointers to objects- this pointer-Pointers to derived classes- Virtual functions and pure virtual functions.
* *File I/O:* File stream classes, opening/closing files, file modes, and sequential I/O operations.
