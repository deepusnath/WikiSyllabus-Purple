## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction
* *Database Approach:* Characteristics, database users (DBA, Designers, End users), and advantages of using a DBMS.
* *Architecture:* Data models, schemas, instances, the three-schema architecture, and data independence.
* *Environment:* DBMS Languages (DDL, DML) and DBMS Component Modules.

### Module 2: Relational Model
* *Entity-Relationship Modeling:* Entity types, entity sets, attributes, keys, relationship types, weak entity types, and ER diagram notation.
* *Relational Concepts:* Domains, attributes, tuples, relations, and their characteristics.
* *Constraints:* Domain constraints, key constraints, entity integrity, referential integrity, and foreign keys.

### Module 3: SQL
* *Data Definition:* Data types and commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and adding constraints.
* *Basic Queries:* INSERT, SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE, LIKE, BETWEEN, and ordering of rows.
* *Set Operations:* UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT.
* *Complex Queries:* Handling NULL values, nested queries, EXISTS, UNIQUE, joining tables, aggregate functions, grouping, and managing views.

### Module 4: Normalization and Indexing
* *Normalization:* Informal design guidelines, functional dependencies, and normal forms (First, Second, Third, and BCNF).
* *Indexing Structures:* Types of single-level ordered indexes, including primary, clustering, and secondary indexes.

### Module 5: Transaction Processing and Database Security
* *Transaction Processing:* Introduction and desirable properties of transactions (ACID properties).
* *Database Security:* Types of security, control measures, the role of the DBA, access control, user accounts, and granting/revoking privileges.
