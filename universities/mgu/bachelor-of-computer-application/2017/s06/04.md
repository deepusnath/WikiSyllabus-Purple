## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Digital Image Fundamentals
* *Core Concepts:* Image, Digital Image, and Digital Image Processing definitions.
* *Applications:* Examples of fields that use DIP, fundamental steps, and components of an image processing system.

### Module 2: Elements of Visual Perception
* *Human & Machine Vision:* Image Formation, Brightness adaptation and Discrimination.
* *Digitization:* Image sampling and quantization, spatial and intensity resolution, and basic relationships among pixels.

### Module 3: Image Enhancement in Spatial and Frequency Domain
* *Spatial Domain:* Intensity Transformation and spatial filtering, including Log Transformations, Power Law Transformations, Histogram Processing, correlation, and convolution.
* *Frequency Domain:* Fourier transform and filtering in the frequency domain.

### Module 4: Morphological Image Processing
