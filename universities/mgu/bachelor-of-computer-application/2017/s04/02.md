## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Information Systems Concepts
* *Business Systems:* Describing the business organization and different levels of information systems.
* *SDLC:* The system development life cycle concepts, activities, flow chart, tasks, and the role of the system analyst.

### Module 2: Introduction to Software Engineering
* *Fundamentals:* Definition of Software Engineering, Program vs. Software, software process, and software characteristics.
* *Life Cycle Models:* Waterfall model, incremental process models (Iterative, RAD), and evolutionary process models (Prototyping, Spiral).

### Module 3: Software Requirement Analysis and Specification
* *Requirements Engineering:* Types of requirements, feasibility studies, and requirement elicitation using Use Cases, DFDs, and Data Dictionaries.
* *Project Planning:* Size estimation, cost estimation, and the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO).

### Module 4: Software Design
* *Design Principles:* Definition, various types, objectives of the design phase, modularity, and strategy of design.
* *Quality Models:* Steps to analyze and design object-oriented systems, software reliability, McCall software quality model, and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM).

### Module 5: Software Testing
* *Testing Fundamentals:* Verification and Validation, Alpha, Beta, and acceptance testing.
* *Techniques:* Functional testing techniques (boundary value analysis, equivalence class testing) and Structural testing (path testing).
* *Levels of Testing:* Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and validation testing.
