# CA4CRT10 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

---
## Course Objectives

* Understand the concepts of algorithm design and analysis, including space and time complexity.
* Apply the Divide and Conquer strategy to solve problems like searching, sorting, and matrix multiplication.
* Use the Greedy Algorithm approach for optimization problems like the Knapsack problem and finding Minimum Spanning Trees.
* Implement Dynamic Programming solutions for problems such as finding the shortest path and the Traveling Salesperson problem.
* Learn basic traversal, search, and backtracking techniques for graphs and problem-solving.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Algorithms
* *Fundamentals:* Definition of an Algorithm, algorithm design techniques, and algorithm analysis.
* *Performance Analysis:* Space complexity, time complexity, and analyzing Best, Worst, and Average case complexity.

### Module 2: Divide and Conquer
* *General Method:* Applying the divide and conquer strategy.
* *Applications:* Binary search, finding maximum and minimum, merge sort, quick sort, selection, and Strassen's matrix multiplication.

### Module 3: Greedy Algorithm
* *General Method:* Characteristics of greedy algorithms and problem-solving using the greedy method.
* *Applications:* Knapsack problem, and Minimum Spanning Trees (using Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms).

### Module 4: Dynamic Programming
* *General Method:* Applying the dynamic programming technique.
* *Applications:* Multistage graphs, all-pairs shortest path, single-source shortest path, 0/1 Knapsack problem, and the Traveling Salesperson problem.

### Module 5: Traversal and Backtracking
* *Traversal Techniques:* Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) and their applications.
* *Backtracking:* The general method and its application to problems like the 8-queens problem, sum of subsets, graph coloring, and Hamiltonian cycles.
