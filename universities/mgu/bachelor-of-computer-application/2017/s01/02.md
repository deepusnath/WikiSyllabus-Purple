# CA1CRT02 - Methodology Of Programming And C Language

---
## Course Objectives

* Understand programming methodologies like algorithms, flowcharts, and control structures.
* Use C language tokens, data types, operators, and expressions.
* Implement decision and loop control statements.
* Work with one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, strings, and pointers.
* Create functions, understand recursion, and use storage classes, structures, and unions.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Programming
* *Fundamentals:* Classification of computer languages, language translators (Assembler, Compiler, Interpreter), Linker.
* *Planning:* Characteristics of a good language, algorithm, flowchart, pseudocode, control structures (sequence, selection, iteration), testing, and debugging.

### Module 2: C Language Basics
* *Tokens:* C Character Set, Delimiters, Types of Tokens, C Keywords, Identifiers, Constants, Variables, Data types, and Type modifiers.
* *Operators & Expressions:* Priority of operators, comma and conditional operator, arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators.

### Module 3: Input/Output and Control Flow
* *I/O:* Formatted and unformatted I/O functions.
* *Decision Statements:* if, if-else, nested if, if-else-if ladder, switch, break, continue, goto.
* *Loop Control:* for, while, and do-while loops, including nested loops.

### Module 4: Arrays and Pointers
* *Arrays:* One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, their initialization, terminology, and operations.
* *Pointers:* Features, pointer and address, declaration, void/wild/constant pointers, arithmetic operations with pointers, and relationship between pointers and arrays.
* *Strings:* Strings and standard library functions.

### Module 5: Functions, Structures, and Unions
* *Functions:* Definition, return statement, types of functions, call by value and reference, recursion.
* *Storage Classes:* auto, extern, static, register.
* *Structures & Unions:* Declaration and initialization of structures, array of structures, pointer to structure, passing structures to functions, typedef, bitfields, enumerated data types, and unions.
* *Memory:* Dynamic memory allocation functions.
