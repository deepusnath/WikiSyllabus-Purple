# CA5CRT14 - Computer Networks

---
## Course Objectives

* Understand fundamental network concepts, data signals, and transmission impairments.
* Compare and contrast the OSI and TCP/IP network models.
* Learn about bandwidth utilization techniques like multiplexing, various transmission media, and switching methods.
* Understand the functions of the data link layer, including error detection, flow control, and multiple access protocols.
* Grasp the roles of the network and transport layers, including logical addressing (IPv4/IPv6) and protocols like UDP and TCP.
* Learn about key application layer protocols and the basics of network security.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Networks
* *Basics:* Introduction to Networks, Data and signals (analog and digital), bit rate, baud rate, and bandwidth.
* *Impairments:* Transmission impairments like attenuation, distortion, and noise.
* *Models:* Data communication protocols, standards, the OSI model, and the TCP/IP protocol suite.

### Module 2: Bandwidth Utilization and Transmission
* *Multiplexing:* FDM, TDM, and spread spectrum.
* *Media:* Guided and unguided transmission media.
* *Switching:* Message, circuit, and packet-switched networks, including datagram and virtual-circuit networks.

### Module 3: Data Link Layer
* *Error Control:* Error Detection and Correction, Framing, flow and error control.
* *Protocols:* Protocols for noiseless channels (Simplest, Stop and Wait) and noisy channels (Stop and Wait, Piggybacking).
* *Multiple Access:* Random Access protocols (ALOHA, CSMA), wired LANs (IEEE standards), wireless LANs, and Cellular Telephony.

### Module 4: Network and Transport Layers
* *Devices:* Repeaters, Bridges, Gateways, and routers.
* *Addressing:* Logical addressing with IPv4 and IPv6.
* *Protocols:* Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6), Connectionless and Connection-Oriented Services (UDP and TCP).
* *Control:* Congestion Control and Quality of Service (QoS).

### Module 5: Application Layer
* *Protocols:* HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
* *Security:* Common threats, Firewalls (advantages and disadvantages), and Cryptography.
