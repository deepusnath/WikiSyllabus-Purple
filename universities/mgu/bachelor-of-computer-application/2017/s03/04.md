## Course Objectives

* Understand the concept of structured data and implement various search and sort algorithms on arrays.
* Learn the organization and operations of stacks and queues and their applications.
* Implement dynamic data structures like singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
* Create and traverse binary trees and binary search trees.
* Understand different file organization methods, including hashing.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Data Structures
* *Concepts:* Data structure definition, types and classification.
* *Arrays:* Memory allocation and implementation, array operations, and applications like sparse matrix representation.
* *Search and Sort:* Linear search, binary search, selection sort, insertion sort, and quick sort.

### Module 2: Stacks and Queues
* *Stacks:* Concepts, organization, and operations on stacks using arrays. Applications like infix to postfix conversion and postfix evaluation.
* *Queues:* Concepts, organization, and operations. Circular queues, double-ended queues, and priority queues.

### Module 3: Linked Lists
* *Dynamic Structures:* Concept of dynamic data structures, types of linked lists, and implementation using pointers.
* *Operations:* Insertion and deletion, circular linked lists, and doubly linked lists.
* *Applications:* Linked stacks and queues, and memory management concepts like garbage collection.

### Module 4: Trees
* *Tree Concepts:* Recursion, tree terminology, binary trees, and their representation (strictly binary, complete, extended).
* *Binary Search Trees:* Creation of binary search trees, tree traversing methods, and binary tree representation of expressions.

### Module 5: File Organization
* *Files:* Definition and sequential file operations.
* *Organization Methods:* Sequential, Indexed sequential, random files, linked organization, inverted files, and cellular partitioning.
* *Hashing:* Hash tables, hashing functions, collisions, and collision resolution methods.
