# BCS3B04: Data Structures using C

## Course Objectives
* Develop effective data organization and manipulation techniques.
* Introduce both linear and non-linear data structures.
* Improve understanding of recursion and memory usage.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Understand the concepts of Abstract Data Types (ADT) and their implementation.
* **CO 2:** Apply stack and queue operations in solving computational problems.
* **CO 3:** Implement and manipulate linked lists for various applications.
* **CO 4:** Construct and traverse tree structures, including binary and AVL trees.
* **CO 5:** Represent and process graphs using standard algorithms.
