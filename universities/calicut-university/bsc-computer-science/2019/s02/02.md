# BCS2B02: Problem Solving Using C

## Course Objectives
* Develop logical and analytical problem-solving skills.
* Introduce structured programming in C.
* Train students to write modular, readable, and maintainable code.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Understand the fundamental concepts of algorithms, flowcharts, and structured programming.
* **CO 2:** Apply C syntax, data types, operators, and control structures to solve problems.
* **CO 3:** Implement modular programming using functions, arrays, and recursion.
* **CO 4:** Manipulate strings and pointers effectively, including dynamic memory allocation.
* **CO 5:** Utilize structures, unions, and file handling in C programs.
