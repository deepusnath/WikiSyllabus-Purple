## Overview

Computability and Complexity Theory explores the theoretical foundations of computer science, examining what problems can be computed and the resources required for computation. This course provides essential theoretical background for understanding the limits and capabilities of computational systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Master models of computation and formal languages
- Understand computability theory and undecidability
- Learn computational complexity classes and their relationships
- Develop skills in mathematical proof and formal reasoning
- Apply theoretical concepts to practical computational problems
