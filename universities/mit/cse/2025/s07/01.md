## Overview

Distributed Systems explores the design and implementation of systems that run across multiple connected computers. This advanced Computer Science track course covers consistency, fault tolerance, scalability, and the fundamental challenges in building reliable distributed applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Master distributed system design principles and trade-offs
- Understand consistency models and consensus algorithms
- Learn fault tolerance and replication strategies
- Develop skills in distributed system implementation
- Apply distributed computing concepts to real-world systems

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1**: Distributed System Fundamentals
- System models and failure modes
- Time and ordering in distributed systems
- Communication protocols and messaging

**Module 2**: Consistency and Replication
- Consistency models and CAP theorem
- Primary-backup and state machine replication
- Quorum systems and eventual consistency

**Module 3**: Consensus and Coordination
- Consensus problem and impossibility results
- Paxos and Raft consensus algorithms
- Leader election and mutual exclusion

**Module 4**: Distributed Storage Systems
- Distributed file systems and databases
